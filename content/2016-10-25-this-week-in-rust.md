## Approved RFCs

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments)
process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* [RFC 1721: Enable customizing the linkage of a platform's C runtime](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1721).
* [RFC 1717: Use `#[link(kind)]` to fix imports from native libs on Windows](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1717).
* [RFC 1682: Propose a shorthand syntax for constructing struct-like values with _named_ fields](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1682).
* [RFC 1624: Let a `loop { ... }` expression return a value via `break my_value;`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1624).

## Final Comment Period

Every week [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the
'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs which are reaching a
decision. Express your opinions now. [This week's FCPs][fcp] are:

[fcp]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/labels/final-comment-period

* [A process for establishing the Rust roadmap](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1728).
* [Windows subsystem support](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1665).
* [Add Cortex-M targets to the compiler + binary releases of `core`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1645).

## New RFCs

* [Roadmap for 2017](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1774).
* [A type representing an owned C-compatible wide string](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1773).

## Style RFCs

[Style RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs) are part of the process for deciding on style guidelines for the Rust community and defaults for [Rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt). The process is similar to the RFC process, but we try to reach rough consensus on issues (including a final comment period) before progressing to PRs. Just like the RFC process, all users are welcome to comment and submit RFCs. If you want to help decide what Rust code should look like, come get involved!

FCP issues:

* [Guiding principles](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/4).
* [Comments](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/17).

Other issues getting a lot of discussion:

* [Imports (`use`)](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/24).
* [Boolean and arithmetic expressions](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/18).
* [Statements](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/11).

_No PRs this week._
