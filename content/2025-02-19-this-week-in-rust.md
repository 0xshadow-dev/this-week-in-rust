## Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [httpmock](https://crates.io/crates/httpmock), which is quite unsurprisingly a HTTP mocking library for Rust.

Thanks to [Jacob Pratt](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704/1409) for the suggestion!

[Please submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

[submit_crate]: https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704

## Calls for Testing
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:

### [RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing)
* *No calls for testing were issued this week.*

### [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/labels/call-for-testing)
* *No calls for testing were issued this week.*

### [Rustup](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/labels/call-for-testing)
* *No calls for testing were issued this week.*

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.

### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

This week's results were dominated by the update to LLVM 20 ([#135763](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/135763)),
which brought a large number of performance improvements, as usually. There were also two other
significant improvements, caused by improving the representation of `const` values ([#136593](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/136593)) and doing less work when formatting in `rustdoc` ([#136828](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/136828)).

Triage done by **@kobzol**.

Revision range: [c03c38d5..ce36a966](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=c03c38d5c2368cd2aa0e056dba060b94fc747f4e&end=ce36a966c79e109dabeef7a47fe68e5294c6d71e&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)
