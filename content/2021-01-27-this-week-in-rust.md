## Rust Compiler Performance Triage

This week continues a trend of relatively large rollups, which often contain
perf-sensitive PRs. We need to get better at marking PRs as rollup=never or
otherwise not including them, but it is unclear how precisely to go about doing
so. The tooling for testing individual PRs merged in rollups should also be
improved to work better in the next few days, though.

Other than that, this week saw several regressions, most of which were not
easily explained. We are seeking feedback from PR authors and reviewers on
whether the results are expected and if anything can be done.

Triage done by **@rylevick** and **@simulacrum**.
Revision range: [e05409a02c6e73a3dea6da98798468db2910ca59..1483e67addd37d9bd20ba3b4613b678ee9ad4d68](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=e05409a02c6e73a3dea6da98798468db2910ca59&end=1483e67addd37d9bd20ba3b4613b678ee9ad4d68&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

5 Regressions, 2 Improvements, 1 Mixed;
3 of them in rollups

See the [full report](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2021-01-26.md) for more.

## Approved RFCs

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments) process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* [Allow "artifact dependencies" on bin, cdylib, and staticlib crates](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3028)

## Final Comment Period

Every week [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the
'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs which are reaching a
decision. Express your opinions now.

# Quote of the Week

> Describing Rust as a systems programming language in 2021 is like describing Microsoft as Windows or Google as search. Yes, Rust is equipped for systems programming, but its applicability is much wider.
