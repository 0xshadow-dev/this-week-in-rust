# Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [include_dir](https://crates.io/crates/include_dir), a crate that lets you include entire directory contents in your binary â€“ like `include_str!`, but on steroids. Thanks to [Michael Bryan](https://users.rust-lang.org/u/Michael-F-Bryan) for the suggestion!

[Submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

## Approved RFCs

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments)
process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* [RFC 1974: Prepare global allocators for stabilization](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1974).

## Final Comment Period

Every week [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the
'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs which are reaching a
decision. Express your opinions now. [This week's FCPs][fcp] are:

[fcp]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/labels/final-comment-period

* [disposition: postpone] [Allow `extern crate` to take a list of crates](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1875).
* [disposition: merge] [Stabilize drop order](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1857).
* [disposition: merge] [Specify `#[repr(transparent)]`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1758).
* [disposition: merge] [Conversions from `&mut T` to `&Cell<T>`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1789).
* [disposition: merge] [Tiered browser support policy for Rust's web content](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1985).

## New RFCs

* [Experimentally add coroutines to Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2033).
* [Add a try_with method to LocalKey, replacing the existing but unstable state method](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2030)

## Style RFCs

[Style RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs) are part of the process for deciding on style guidelines for the Rust community and defaults for [Rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt). The process is similar to the RFC process, but we try to reach rough consensus on issues (including a final comment period) before progressing to PRs. Just like the RFC process, all users are welcome to comment and submit RFCs. If you want to help decide what Rust code should look like, come get involved!

We're making good progress and the style is coming together. If you want to see the style in practice, check out [our example](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/blob/master/example/lists.rs) or use the [Integer32 Playground](https://play.integer32.com/) and select 'Proposed RFC' from the 'Format' menu. Be aware that implementation is work in progress.

Issues in final comment period:

* [[macro_use] on the same line as crate](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/83)
* [trait bounds](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/80)
* [Specify rules for breaking long `where` conditions](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/75)
* [Single-line `where`](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/74)
* [Combining openings and closings](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/61)

Good first issues:
