# Summer of Code Projects

Hi students! Looking for an awesome summer project in Rust? Look no further! Chris Holcombe from Canonical is an experienced Google Summer of Code mentor and has a project to implement CephX protocol decoding. [Check it out here](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/GoogleSoC2016/Ideas#Decode_CephX_Protocol).

Servo is also accepting GoSC project submissions under the Mozilla banner. See if any of the [project ideas](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Community:SummerOfCode16#Servo) appeal to you and read the [advice for applications](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Community:SummerOfCode16#Application_Advice).

Servo also has [a project](https://teams.railsgirlssummerofcode.org/projects/104-servo) in Rails Girls Summer of Code. nom is [also participating](https://teams.railsgirlssummerofcode.org/projects/78-nom).
