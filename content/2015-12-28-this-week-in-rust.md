# Crate of the Week

This week's Crate of the Week is [handlebars-rust](https://github.com/sunng87/handlebars-rust), an implementation of the Handlebars templating language for Rust. It also allows custom helpers and template inheritance for real-world usage. Thanks to [@sunng](https://users.rust-lang.org/users/sunng) for the suggestion.

[Submit your suggestions for next week][submit_crate]!
