# Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [color-backtrace](https://github.com/athre0z/color-backtrace), a crate to give panic backtraces more information (and some color, too). Thanks to [Willi Kappler](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704/518) for the suggestion!

[Submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!
