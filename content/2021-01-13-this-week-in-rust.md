# Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [fast-float](https://github.com/aldanor/fast-float-rust), a crate providing methods to parse floats *really* fast.

Thanks to [Willi Kappler](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704/868) for the suggestion!

[Submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

## Rust Compiler Performance Triage

* [2020-01-12](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2021-01-12.md):
1 Regressions, 2 Improvements, 3 Mixed
Overall, a positive albeit quiet week. The largest change came from the incremental compilation working group which delivered large gains in performance caused by [changes](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/76896) in how inlining is handled in debug mode. Unfortunately, these changes may be reversed due to concerns

Triage done by @rylev.

See the [full report](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2021-01-12.md) for more.

# Quote of the Week

> Rust favours security over convenience. Rust does not want you to make silly little mistakes than can waste so much of your time debugging, which in the end makes it more convenient.
