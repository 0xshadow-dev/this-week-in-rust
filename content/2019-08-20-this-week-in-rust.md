# Quote of the Week

> C++ being memory safe is like saying riding a motorcycle is crash safe.
>
> It totally is, if you happen to have the knowledge and experience to realize this is only true if you remember to put on body-armor, a helmet, a full set of leathers including gloves and reinforced boots, and then remember to operate the motorcycle correctly afterwards. In C/C++ though, that armor is completely 100% optional.
