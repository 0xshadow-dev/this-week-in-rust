## Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [synth](https://github.com/getsynth/synth), a declarative test data generator written in Rust.

[llogiq](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704/942) shamelessly used his recent self-suggestion for lack of another nomination.

[Please submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

A fairly busy week which was to expected given that we've [adjusted our algorithm](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/956) for whether we label a change as a regression or not. Most regressions were relatively small, and only one has not yet been addressed in some way.

Triage done by **@rylev**.
Revision range: [6b2050..aa8f27](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=6b20506d17f4e5e5bf5bcad7e94add4d754b0ae3&end=aa8f27bf4d980023a8b245ceb25a490a18041eb2&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

59 comparisons made in total
3 Regressions, 2 Improvements, 2 Mixed; 0 of them in rollups

[Full report here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2021-08-17.md).

### Approved RFCs

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments) process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

*No RFCs were approved this week.*

# Quote of the Week

> **Rust** : You can't move your object and try to keep it, too.  
> **Me** : Ok, I suppose I can clone it?  
> **Rust** : Then implement a clone method.  
> **Me** : Why am I getting a stack overflow?  
> **Rust** : It is never a good idea for a clone method to call itself.  
> **Me** : I just wanted to simplify the trivial cases.  
> **Rust** : It is still not a good idea for a clone method to call itself.  
> **Me** : I can't believe I have gotten myself into this.
