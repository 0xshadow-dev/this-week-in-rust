## Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [wtx](https://github.com/c410-f3r/wtx), a batteries-included web application framework.

Thanks to [Caio](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704/1333) for the self-suggestion!

[Please submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

[submit_crate]: https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704

## Calls for Testing
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:

### [RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing)
* *No calls for testing were issued this week.*

### [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/labels/call-for-testing)
* *No calls for testing were issued this week.*

### [Rustup](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/labels/call-for-testing)
* *No calls for testing were issued this week.*

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.

# Quote of the Week

> ... opaque number sequences (\<GitHub\> "issue numbers") are not very informative about what is behind that pointer, and pretending they are is harmful. People could provide, instead, actual reasons for things, which do not require dereferencing random pointers, which thrashes cache.
