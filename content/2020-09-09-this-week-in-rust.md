## Rust Compiler Performance Triage

* [2020-09-08](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2020-09-08.md):
  3 regressions, 0 improvements.
  
A few small compile-time regressions this week. The first was
[#70793](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/70793), which added some
specializations to the standard library in order to increase runtime
performance. The second was
[#73996](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/73996), which adds an option to
the diagnostics code to print only the names of types and traits when they are
unique instead of the whole path. The third was
[#75200](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/75200), which refactored part
of `BTreeMap` to avoid aliasing mutable references.

## Approved RFCs

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments) process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

*No RFCs were approved this week.*

# Quote of the Week

> It's amazing how frequent such "rare edge cases" can be. Especially when there are millions of people using billions of files originating from God know what operating systems. Far better things are checked properly if one want robust code. As Rust uses do.
