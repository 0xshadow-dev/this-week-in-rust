Category: This Week in Rust

Hello and welcome to another issue of *This Week in Rust*!
[Rust](http://rust-lang.org) is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed. This is a weekly summary of its progress and
community. Want something mentioned? [Send me an
email!](mailto:corey@octayn.net?subject=This%20Week%20in%20Rust%20Suggestion)
Want to get involved? [We love
contributions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/wiki/Note-guide-for-new-contributors).

*This Week in Rust* is openly developed [on GitHub](https://github.com/cmr/this-week-in-rust).

# Breaking Changes

* [Prevent raw pointers from being used as explicit
  self](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/26225). Probably nobody
  has ever tried to write such code, and the current implemented
  behavior is bonkers.

# Other Changes

* [Add `Result::expect`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/25359/files).
* [Add
  `CString::from_ptr/into_ptr`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/25777). For
  transfering ownership of C strings across the FFI.
* [Implement `str::split_at`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/25839).
* [Stabilize a number of new `fs` features](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/25844).
* [Parallel code generation works
  again](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/26018). Pass `rustc -C
  codegen-units=4` to try.
* [The `to_uppercase` and `to_lowercase` functions now support complex
  case mapping](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/26039). This
  changes the behavior of the *stable*
  `char::to_uppercase/to_lowercase` and also stabilizes
  `str::to_uppercase/to_lowercase`.
* [Implement `Extend<&T> where: T: Copy` for a variety of collection
  types](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/25989).
* [The unstable `String::from_str` is
  deprecated](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/26077). Use
  `String::from`.
* [Heuristics for detecting identifier typos are improved](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/26087).

# Approved RFCs

* [RFC 1105. Policy on API
  evolution](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1105-api-evolution.md). Describes
  how the Rust project evaluates changes to the libraries, and which are allowed when.
* [RFC 1119. `Result::expect`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1119).
* [RFC 1122. Semantic
  versioning](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1122-language-semver.md). Describes
  how the language itself is allowed to change.
* [RFC 1123. Introduce `str::split_at`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1123-str-split-at.md)
* [RFC 1131. `likely` intrinsic](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1131-likely-intrinsic.md). For hinting hot and cold branches.

# New RFCs

* [Adjust default object
bounds](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1156). This fixes some
dumb rules that made it into 1.0, but is a breaking change that
affects relatively little code.
* [Expand the `std::net` module](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1158).

# Quote of the Week

```text
<Quxxy> I had a fun one in cargo script: there's currently no way in Rust
to get a file's mtime and the system time in the same time format
<Quxxy> (On Windows)
<Quxxy> You can get one in UNIX time, the other in Windows time
<Quxxy> Which have different scales and different epochs
<Quxxy> Rust: Buy Your Own Damn Batteries; What Are You, A Communist?
```

Quxxy discovers Rust's stance toward the inclusion of batteries.

Thanks to cmr for the tip. [Submit your quotes for next week!][submit].
