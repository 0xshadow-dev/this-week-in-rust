## Rust Compiler Performance Triage

* [2020-01-05](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2021-01-05.md):
0 Regressions, 2 Improvements, 2 Mixed
This was a somewhat quiet week with the exception of large gains to the `ctfe` 
(const function) stress test benchmark caused by changes to how rustc serializes
and deserializes cache from disk.

Triage done by @rylev.

See the [full report](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2021-01-05.md) for more.
