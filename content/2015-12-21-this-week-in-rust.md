# Crate of the Week

This week's Crate of the Week is [clippy](https://github.com/Manishearth/rust-clippy), a collection of lints for better Rust code. Alas, being a plugin, it only runs on nightly Rust, but that's easy to do with [multirust](https://github.com/brson/multirust). Thanks to [leodasvacas](https://users.rust-lang.org/users/leodasvacas) for the suggestion.

[Submit your suggestions for next week][submit_crate]!
