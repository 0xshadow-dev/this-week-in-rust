# Crate of the Week

This week's crate of the week is (the in best TWiR-tradition shamelessly self-promoted) [mysql-proxy](https://crates.io/crates/mysql-proxy), a flexible, lightweight and scalable proxy for MySQL databases. Thanks to [andygrove](https://users.rust-lang.org/users/andygrove) for the suggestion!

[Submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

## Approved RFCs

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments)
process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* [RFC 1696: `mem::discriminant()`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1696). Add a function that extracts the discriminant from an enum variant as a comparable, hashable, printable, but (for now) opaque and unorderable type.

## Final Comment Period

Every week [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the
'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs which are reaching a
decision. Express your opinions now. [This week's FCPs][fcp] are:

[fcp]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/labels/final-comment-period

* [Let a `loop { ... }` expression return a value via `break my_value;`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1624).
* [Add a compiler flag that emits crate dependencies on a best-effort basis](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1622).
* [Generalize the delayed resolution of language items to arbitrary items](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1408).

## New RFCs

* [Crates.io should offer an API to release security advisories for crates](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1752).
