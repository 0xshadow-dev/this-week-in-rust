## Approved RFCs

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments)
process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* [RFC 1665: Windows subsystem support](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1665).

## Final Comment Period

Every week [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the
'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs which are reaching a
decision. Express your opinions now. [This week's FCPs][fcp] are:

[fcp]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/labels/final-comment-period

* [A process for establishing the Rust roadmap](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1728).
* [Introduce a new type `MoveCell<T>` in `std::cell`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1659).

## New RFCs

* [Warn by default when casting a pointer to an integer smaller than usize](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1782).
* [Add Cargo post-build scripts](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1777).

## Style RFCs

[Style RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs) are part of the process for deciding on style guidelines for the Rust community and defaults for [Rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt). The process is similar to the RFC process, but we try to reach rough consensus on issues (including a final comment period) before progressing to PRs. Just like the RFC process, all users are welcome to comment and submit RFCs. If you want to help decide what Rust code should look like, come get involved!

PRs:

* [Customising Rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/pull/33).

[Issue 17](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/17) (comments) is ready for a PR, we'd love someone to help out with that, if you're interested ping someone in #rust-style.

Final comment period:

* [Statements](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/11).
* [static mut capitalisation](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/20).
* [Simple blocks, `{ ... }`](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/21).

New P-high issues:

* [Struct and union declarations](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/30).
* [Enums and variants](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/31).
* [`type` aliases](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/32).

# Quote of the Week

> Every once in a while someone discovers a bug in librsvg that makes it all the way to a CVE security advisory. We've gotten double free()s, wrong casts, and out-of-bounds memory accesses. Recently someone did fuzz-testing with some really pathological SVGs, and found interesting explosions in the library. That's the kind of 1970s bullshit that Rust prevents.

— [Federico on porting librsvg to Rust](https://people.gnome.org/~federico/news-2016-10.html#25).

Thanks to [/u/robinst and /u/cjstevenson1](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/59d2ql/librsvg_gets_rusty/d97ui7q/) for the suggestion.
