# Crate of the Week

Somewhat unsurprisingly, this week's crate of the week is [ripgrep](https://crates.io/crates/ripgrep). In case you've missed it, this is a grep/ag/pt/whatever search tool you use replacement that absolutely smokes the competition in most performance tests. Thanks to [DanielKeep](https://users.rust-lang.org/users/DanielKeep) for the suggestion!

[Submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!
