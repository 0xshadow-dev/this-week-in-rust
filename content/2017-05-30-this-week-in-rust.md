## Approved RFCs

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments)
process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* [RFC 1951: Finalize syntax and parameter scoping for `impl Trait`, while expanding it to arguments](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1951).
* [RFC 1859: Introduce a trait `Try` for customizing the behavior of the `?`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1859).

## Final Comment Period

Every week [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the
'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs which are reaching a
decision. Express your opinions now. [This week's FCPs][fcp] are:

[fcp]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/labels/final-comment-period

* [disposition: merge] [Specify `#[repr(transparent)]`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1758).
* [disposition: close] [Implement adaptive hashing for HashMap](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1796).

## New RFCs

* [Future-proofing enums/structs with `#[non_exhaustive]` attribute](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2008).
* [Const/static type annotation elision](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2010). Allow elision of type annotations in many cases for const and static items, as part of the ergonomics initiative.
* [Make the `assert!` macro generic to all expressions, and extend the readability of debug dumps](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2011).

## Style RFCs

[Style RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs) are part of the process for deciding on style guidelines for the Rust community and defaults for [Rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt). The process is similar to the RFC process, but we try to reach rough consensus on issues (including a final comment period) before progressing to PRs. Just like the RFC process, all users are welcome to comment and submit RFCs. If you want to help decide what Rust code should look like, come get involved!

We're making good progress and the style is coming together. If you want to see the style in practice, check out [our example](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/blob/master/example/lists.rs) or use the [Integer32 Playground](https://play.integer32.com/) and select 'Proposed RFC' from the 'Format' menu. Be aware that implementation is work in progress.

Issues in final comment period:

* [Combining opening and closing delims](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/61)

Good first issues:

We're happy to mentor these, please reach out to us in #rust-style if you'd like to get involved

* [simple expressions](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/68)
* [assignment and assignment operators](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/67)
