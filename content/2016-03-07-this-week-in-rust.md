# Summer of Code Projects

Hi students! Looking for an awesome summer project in Rust? Look no further! Chris Holcombe from Canonical is an experienced Google Summer of Code mentor and has a project to implement CephX protocol decoding. [Check it out here](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/GoogleSoC2016/Ideas#Decode_CephX_Protocol).

Servo is also accepting GoSC project submissions under the Mozilla banner. See if any of the [project ideas](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Community:SummerOfCode16#Servo) appeal to you and read the [advice for applications](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Community:SummerOfCode16#Application_Advice).

Servo also has [a project](https://teams.railsgirlssummerofcode.org/projects/104-servo) in Rails Girls Summer of Code. nom is [also participating](https://teams.railsgirlssummerofcode.org/projects/78-nom).

## Notable changes

* [rustdoc: Split out rustdoc pass to strip private imports](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/32055). No more private imports in rustdoc.
* [Improve the `check_pat_enum` logic](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/32039). rustc will catch missing fields in pattern matches again.
* [Truncate i8-s to i1-s when loading constants](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/32032). Regression fix for LLVM type errors with bools.
* [Use `drop_in_place` in `Vec` and `VecDeque`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/32012). Vecs and VecDeques now drop faster.
* [Extend compiletest to support revisions, incremental tests](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/32007).
* [Use raw pointer casts for `slice`, `str`'s `.as_ptr()`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/31999). `slice.as_ptr` generates simpler LLVM IR.
* [Update libc](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/31996).
* [Changed `std::pattern::Pattern` impl on `&'a &'a str` to `&'a &'b str`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/31989). Patterns can now be pointers-to-pointers to str with different lifetimes.
* [Fix compiling libstd with emscripten target](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/31985). libstd can now be compiled with emscripten.
* [Use HIR map instead of tcx in constant evaluator](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/31962). One less internal compiler error with trait consts.
* [Implement RFC 1461](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/31945). Move some net2 functionality into libstd.
* [std: Stabilize APIs for the 1.8 release](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/31928).
* [Give `Name`s to positional fields and merge them with named fields](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/31937). Positional fields are now named starting from "0", "1", ...
* [Use `box` syntax in `vec!` macro](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/31797). `vec![..]` no longer copies from the stack.
* [[MIR] Some initial zeroing implementation work](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/31430). Zeroing on drop.
* [Add `AsciiExt::into_ascii_{upper,lower}case`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/31335).
* [Implement RFC 1192 inclusive ranges](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/30884).
