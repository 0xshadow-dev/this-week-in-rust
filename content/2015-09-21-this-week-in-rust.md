## Approved RFCs

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments)
process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These

# Crate of the Week

This is a new part of this weekly installation, where we will write about a crate that some of you may not know.
Please nominate a crate of your choice at the [rust-users thread](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704/15) so we can write about it next week.

This week, Crate of the Week is **[lazy_static](https://crates.io/crates/lazy_static)**. Thanks go to [stebalien](https://users.rust-lang.org/users/stebalien) for the suggestion.

This week's Crate of the Week does something some won't know is possible, and does it in a natural way. You know how in some languages you have to run through hoops to correctly lazily instantiate stuff? Not in Rust, for thanks to the [lazy_static](https://crates.io/crates/lazy_static) crate you just put your static values inside a `lazy_static! { ... }` block, pay a modest runtime cost on lookup and be done.

Btw, this aligns very well with the C++ adage *"... and what you pay for, you couldn't have written any better"*.

# Quote of the Week

*Transmute is taking a dog, sawing its front legs off, gluing on a pair of buffalo wings and telling it it's a duck so it damn well better start quacking
You should not be surprised when you end up with a pile of gore and a dead dog instead of an actual duck :-P* — Quxxy

Thanks to [Ms2ger](https://users.rust-lang.org/users/Ms2ger) for the tip. [Submit your quotes for next week!][submit].
