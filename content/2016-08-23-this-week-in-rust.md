## Approved RFCs

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments)
process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* [RFC 1679: Add "panic-safe" or "total" alternatives to the existing panicking indexing syntax](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1679).
* [RFC 1640: Add `checked_sub()` already known from various primitive types to the `Duration` struct](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1640).
* [RFC 1589: Define a best practices procedure for making bug fixes in the compiler](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1589).
* [RFC 1561: Macro naming and modularisation](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1561).
* [RFC 1623: Omit `'static` lifetimes to reference or generics lifetime values in `static` or `const` declarations](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1623).
* [RFC 1681: Procedural macros 1.1](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1681).

## Final Comment Period

Every week [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the
'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs which are reaching a
decision. Express your opinions now. [This week's FCPs][fcp] are:

[fcp]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/labels/final-comment-period

* [Add a compiler flag that emits crate dependencies on a best-effort basis](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1622).
* [regex 1.0](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1620).
* [Allow type aliases in enumeration repr attributes](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1605).
* [Introduce `dyn` keyword](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1603).

* [`libstd::sys`, the great `libstd` refactor](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1502).

## New RFCs

* [A process for establishing the Rust roadmap](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1728).
