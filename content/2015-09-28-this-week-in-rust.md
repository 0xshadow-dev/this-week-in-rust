# Crate of the Week

This Week, Crate of the Week is BurntSushi's [quickcheck](https://github.com/BurntSushi/quickcheck). Out of all [quickcheck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quickcheck) implementations, this is probably one of the more impressive ones. Thanks to DanielKeep, who had [this](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704/40) to say:

    It helps write property-based tests: you define some property and how to test it, and quickcheck feeds your test random inputs as it tries to narrow down the ranges within which the property fails to hold. Handy when the set of possible test cases is very large.

I'd like to add an appeal to all supporters of "repeatable tests". Don't let the worthy goal of repeatability override the worthier goal of actually finding bugs. Your deterministic tests usually cannot even make a dent in the vast space of possible inputs. With a bit of randomness thrown in, you can greatly improve you chances and thus make your tests more valuable. Also with quickcheck, you get to see a _minimized_ input that makes your test fail, which you can then turn into a repeatable test easily.

# Quote of the Week

*If one regards Rust as a critique to C++, it certainly should be seen as a constructive critique.* â€” [llogiq on /r/cpp](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/3m0d41/writing_good_c14_by_default_herb_sutter/cvdipz7).

Thanks to [msiemens](https://users.rust-lang.org/users/msiemens) for the tip. [Submit your quotes for next week][submit]!
