# Quote of the Week

> what many devs often miss initially when talking about Rust is that it isn't just about the design & details of the language (which is great), Rust's super power is that in combination with its fantastic community & ecosystem, and the amazing friendly people that create & form it

â€“ [Johann Andersson on twitter](https://mobile.twitter.com/repi)

llogiq is pretty pleased with his own suggestion and unanimously voted for it.

[Please submit quotes and vote for next week!](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/twir-quote-of-the-week/328)
