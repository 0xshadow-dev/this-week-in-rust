# Crate of the Week

This week's crates are [pointer-utils](https://github.com/CAD97/pointer-utils), a small library for working with pointers, and [jlrs](https://github.com/Taaitaaiger/jlrs), a crate to call [Julia](https://julialang.org) from Rust.

Thanks to [Vikrant](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704/729) for the suggestions!
