# Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [Askama](https://crates.io/crates/askama), a Jinja-like type-safe compiled templating engine. Thanks to [Icefoxen](https://users.rust-lang.org/u/Icefoxen) for the suggestion!

[Submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

# Call for Participation

Always wanted to contribute to open-source projects but didn't know where to start?
Every week we highlight some tasks from the Rust community for you to pick and get started!

Some of these tasks may also have mentors available, visit the task page for more information.

* [rustc-guide](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustc-guide) is a project to write a short guide about how the rust compiler works, and it needs your help. There are some [easier issues](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustc-guide/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AEasy), [issues which might require a bit of investigation/code reading](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustc-guide/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AMedium), and [issues which probably require some advanced knowledge or a lot of time](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustc-guide/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AHard).
* [annotate-snippets](https://github.com/zbraniecki/annotate-snippets-rs) - a crate for code snippets visual annotations (think: rustc error display) released 0.1 and is looking for code review, testing, and feedback.
* [Get started with these beginner-friendly issues](https://www.rustaceans.org/findwork/starters).

If you are a Rust project owner and are looking for contributors, please submit tasks [here][guidelines].
