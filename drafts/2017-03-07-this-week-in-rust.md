## Approved RFCs

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments)
process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

*No RFCs were approved this week.*

## Final Comment Period

Every week [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the
'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs which are reaching a
decision. Express your opinions now. [This week's FCPs][fcp] are:

[fcp]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/labels/final-comment-period

* [disposition: postpone] [Introduce _pattern synonyms_ - used to create new patterns we can pattern match against from real patterns](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1895).
* [disposition: close] [Add a `Transmute<T>` trait for representing types that can be transmuted to `T`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1891).
* [disposition: merge] [Write to standard error with `eprint!` and `eprintln!`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1869).
* [disposition: merge] [extend `?` to operate over other types](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1859).
* [disposition: close] [Add 'else match' blocks to if expressions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1712).
* [disposition: postpone] [Allow uncallable method impls to be omitted](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1699).
* [disposition: merge] [Deprecate anonymous parameters](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1685).
* [disposition: postpone] [Add the ability to define closures that are generic over types](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1650).
* [disposition: close] [Add `&move` pointers, the `DerefMove` trait, and the unsafe `DerefPure` traits](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1646).

## New RFCs

* [dependent-types (also known as, Œ†-types and value-types)](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1931).
* [Introduce `with` bounds for pi types](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1932).
* [Fully dependent pi types](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1933).
* [Allow an optional vert at the beginning of a match branch](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1925).
* [Reduce the number of constraints repeated when writing `T: SomeTrait`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1927).
* [Tuple-based variadic generics](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1935).

## Style RFCs

[Style RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs) are part of the process for deciding on style guidelines for the Rust community and defaults for [Rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt). The process is similar to the RFC process, but we try to reach rough consensus on issues (including a final comment period) before progressing to PRs. Just like the RFC process, all users are welcome to comment and submit RFCs. If you want to help decide what Rust code should look like, come get involved!

PRs:

* [structs and unions](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/pull/53)

Issues in final comment period:

* [`extern` vs `extern "C"`](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/52)
* [Whitespace in associated type syntax](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/51).
* [types](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/15)

Other significant issues:

* [ranges](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/60)
* [where clauses](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/38)
