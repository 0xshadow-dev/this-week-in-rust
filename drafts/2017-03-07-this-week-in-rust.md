## Approved RFCs

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments)
process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

*No RFCs were approved this week.*

## Final Comment Period

Every week [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the
'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs which are reaching a
decision. Express your opinions now. [This week's FCPs][fcp] are:

[fcp]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/labels/final-comment-period


* [disposition: merge] [Write to standard error with `eprint!` and `eprintln!`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1869).
* [disposition: merge] [extend `?` to operate over other types](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1859).
* [disposition: merge] [`From<&[T]> for Rc<[T]> + From<&str> for Rc<str>`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1845).
* [disposition: close] [Add variable-length arrays to the language](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1808).
* [disposition: merge] [Extend entry API to work on borrowed keys](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1769).
* [disposition: merge] [Deprecate anonymous parameters](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1685).

## New RFCs

* [Intra Rustdoc Links](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1946).
* [Polymorphic Numeric Constants](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1945).
* [Improve match ergonomics](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1944).
* [Guess diagnostics](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1941). `rustfix` should be the semantic companion to `rustfmt`, which automatically changes code to be more idiomatic.
* [Support the `#[must_use]` attribute on arbitrary functions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1940).
* [Allow the `?` operator to be used in `main`, and in `#[test]` functions and doctests](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1937).

## Style RFCs

[Style RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs) are part of the process for deciding on style guidelines for the Rust community and defaults for [Rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt). The process is similar to the RFC process, but we try to reach rough consensus on issues (including a final comment period) before progressing to PRs. Just like the RFC process, all users are welcome to comment and submit RFCs. If you want to help decide what Rust code should look like, come get involved!

Issues in final comment period:

* [structs and unions](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/pull/53)
* [where clauses](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/38)

Other significant issues:

* [types](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/15)
* [Whitespace in associated type syntax](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/51).
* [`extern` vs `extern "C"`](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/52)
* [ranges](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/60)
