Hello and welcome to another issue of *This Week in Rust*!
[Rust](http://rust-lang.org) is a systems language pursuing the trifecta: safety, concurrency, and speed.
This is a weekly summary of its progress and community.

## Approved RFCs

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments)
process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* [RFC 1566: Procedural macros](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1566).

## Final Comment Period

Every week [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the
'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs which are reaching a
decision. Express your opinions now. [This week's FCPs][fcp] are:

[fcp]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/labels/final-comment-period

* [Roadmap for 2017](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1774).
* [`core::mem::replace_with` for temporarily moving out of ownership](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1736).
* [Add a 'thread lifetime, which denotes a thread-bounded region](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1705).
* [Allow `Self` to appear in the where clause of trait impls](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1647).
* [Macros by example 2.0. A replacement for `macro_rules!`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1584).
* [Allow coercing non-capturing closures to function pointers](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1558).

## New RFCs

* [Stackless coroutines](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1823). Add language-level support for stackless coroutines (also known as semicoroutines or generators).
* [Proposal for default crate recommendation ranking](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1824).

## Style RFCs

[Style RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs) are part of the process for deciding on style guidelines for the Rust community and defaults for [Rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt). The process is similar to the RFC process, but we try to reach rough consensus on issues (including a final comment period) before progressing to PRs. Just like the RFC process, all users are welcome to comment and submit RFCs. If you want to help decide what Rust code should look like, come get involved!

PRs:

* [Conventions for Cargo.toml files (FCP)](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/pull/41).

Ready for PR:

There's [a lot of them](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aready-for-PR) right now, contributions here would be very welcome. If you want advice or help getting started, please ping nrc, or any other member of the style team, in #rust-style.

Issues in final comment period:

* [function declarations](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/39).
