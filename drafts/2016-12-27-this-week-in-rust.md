## Approved RFCs

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments)
process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

*No RFCs were approved this week.*

## Final Comment Period

Every week [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the
'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs which are reaching a
decision. Express your opinions now. [This week's FCPs][fcp] are:

[fcp]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/labels/final-comment-period

* [Roadmap for 2017](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1774).
* [`core::mem::replace_with` for temporarily moving out of ownership](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1736).
* [Add a 'thread lifetime, which denotes a thread-bounded region](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1705).
* [Allow `Self` to appear in the where clause of trait impls](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1647).
* [Macros by example 2.0. A replacement for `macro_rules!`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1584).
* [Allow coercing non-capturing closures to function pointers](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1558).
* [Add Rvalue-static-promotion](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1414).

## New RFCs

* [Rust bookshelf](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1828). Create a "Rust Bookshelf" of learning resources for Rust.
* [Change the default URL of doc.rust-lang.org](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1826).

## Style RFCs

[Style RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs) are part of the process for deciding on style guidelines for the Rust community and defaults for [Rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt). The process is similar to the RFC process, but we try to reach rough consensus on issues (including a final comment period) before progressing to PRs. Just like the RFC process, all users are welcome to comment and submit RFCs. If you want to help decide what Rust code should look like, come get involved!

Ready for PR:

There's [a lot of them](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aready-for-PR) right now, contributions here would be very welcome. If you want advice or help getting started, please ping nrc, or any other member of the style team, in #rust-style.

Issues in final comment period:

* [Conventions for Cargo.toml files (FCP)](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/pull/41).
* [function declarations](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/39).

# Quote of the Week

> scott: see, at christmas, if I unwrap() my present and I find that it's empty, I immediately have a panic attack and everyone gets really freaked out. if I expect() a present, at least I can send a stern message before I start panicking in the living room.
> scott: sometimes I decide ahead of time that if I start having a panic attack, I'm just going to abort the whole christmas thing entirely and leave
> scott: but it's easier to unwind if I don't abort and stick around
