# Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [noisy_float](https://crates.io/crates/noisy_float), a crate with surprisingly useful floating point types that would rather panic than be Not a Number. Thanks to [Ayose Cazorla](https://users.rust-lang.org/u/ayosec) for the suggestion.

[Submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

# Call for Participation

Always wanted to contribute to open-source projects but didn't know where to start?
Every week we highlight some tasks from the Rust community for you to pick and get started!

Some of these tasks may also have mentors available, visit the task page for more information.

* If youâ€™re interested in language design, please help us polish up [the new Delegation RFC draft](https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/new-rfc-for-delegation-anyone-interested-in-contributing/6644/8).
* [rustc-guide](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustc-guide) is a project to write a short guide about how the rust compiler works, and it needs your help. There are some [easier issues](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustc-guide/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AEasy), [issues which might require a bit of investigation/code reading](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustc-guide/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AMedium), and [issues which probably require some advanced knowledge or a lot of time](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustc-guide/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AHard).
* [Get started with these beginner-friendly issues](https://www.rustaceans.org/findwork/starters).

If you are a Rust project owner and are looking for contributors, please submit tasks [here][guidelines].

## Approved RFCs

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments)
process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* [RFC 2300: `Self` in type definitions allowing `enum List<T> { Nil, Cons(T, Box<Self>) }`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2300).

## Final Comment Period

Every week [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the
'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs which are reaching a
decision. Express your opinions now. [This week's FCPs][fcp] are:

# Quote of the Week

> If Rust is martial arts teacher, Perl is a pub brawler. If you survive either, youâ€™re likely to be good at defending yourself, though both can be painful at times.
