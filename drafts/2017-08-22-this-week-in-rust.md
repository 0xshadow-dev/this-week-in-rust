## Approved RFCs

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments)
process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

*No RFCs were approved this week.*

## Final Comment Period

Every week [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the
'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs which are reaching a
decision. Express your opinions now. [This week's FCPs][fcp] are:

[fcp]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/labels/final-comment-period

* [disposition: merge] [Evolving Rust through checkpoints](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2052).
* [disposition: close] [Zero-Sized References](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2040).
* [disposition: merge] [Generic associated types (associated type constructors)](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1598).
* [disposition: close] [Allow use of pipe operator in patterns](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1882).
* [disposition: merge] [Allow an optional vert at the beginning of a match branch](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1925).
* [disposition: merge] [Unsafe pointer methods](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1966).
* [disposition: merge] [Amend RFC 1242 to require an RFC for deprecation of crates from the nursery](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1983).
* [disposition: merge] [Add external doc attribute to rustc](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1990).
* [disposition: close] [Match branch semicolon](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1994).

* [disposition: merge] [Enable nested method calls](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2025).

## New RFCs

* [Module redesign](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2108).
* [Ok wrapping: Improved support for writing code from an error handling mindset](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2107).
* [Introduce more potentially useful environment-related functions to `std::env`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2101).
* [Unnamed fields of struct and union type](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2102).
* [Attributes for tools, 2.0](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2103).
* [Rand crate revision (pre-stabilisation)](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2106). Evaluate options for the future of `rand` regarding both cryptographic and non-cryptographic uses.

## Style RFCs

[Style RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs) are part of the process for deciding on style guidelines for the Rust community and defaults for [Rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt). The process is similar to the RFC process, but we try to reach rough consensus on issues (including a final comment period) before progressing to PRs. Just like the RFC process, all users are welcome to comment and submit RFCs. If you want to help decide what Rust code should look like, come get involved!

The RFC style is now the default style in Rustfmt - try it out and let us know what you think!

Nothing of note this week.
