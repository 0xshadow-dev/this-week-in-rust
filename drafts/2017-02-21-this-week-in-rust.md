## Approved RFCs

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments)
process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* [RFC 1558: Allow coercing non-capturing closures to function pointers](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1558).

## Final Comment Period

Every week [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the
'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs which are reaching a
decision. Express your opinions now. [This week's FCPs][fcp] are:

[fcp]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/labels/final-comment-period

* [disposition: close] [Add a `Transmute<T>` trait for representing types that can be transmuted to `T`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1891).
* [disposition: merge] [Deprecate anonymous parameters](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1685).
* [disposition: close] [Warn by default when encountering a statement which only consists of an equality comparison](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1812).
* [Allow uncallable method impls to be omitted](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1699).

## Closed RFCs

Following proposals were rejected by [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) after their 'final comment period' elapsed.

*No RFCs were closed this week!*

## New RFCs

* [Amend RFC 1105 to specify how dependency versions relate to semver](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1890).
* [Deprecate uninitialized for uninhabited types](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1892).
* [Introduce _pattern synonyms_ - used to create new patterns we can pattern match against from real patterns](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1895).
* [Unions 1.2](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1897).

## Style RFCs

[Style RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs) are part of the process for deciding on style guidelines for the Rust community and defaults for [Rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt). The process is similar to the RFC process, but we try to reach rough consensus on issues (including a final comment period) before progressing to PRs. Just like the RFC process, all users are welcome to comment and submit RFCs. If you want to help decide what Rust code should look like, come get involved!

PRs:

* [match](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/pull/56)
* [type aliases](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/pull/55)
* [structs and unions](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/pull/53)

Issues in final comment period:

* [`extern` vs `extern "C"`](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/52)
* [Whitespace in associated type syntax](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/51).
* [types](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/15)

Other significant issues:

* [ranges](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/60)
* [where clauses](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/38)
