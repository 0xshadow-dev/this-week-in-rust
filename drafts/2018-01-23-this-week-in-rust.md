# Quote of the Week

> Anything that will make wasm nicer will be awesome, but honestly, Iâ€™m thrilled with what weâ€™ve got. It feels absolutely insane that I can just compile this language thatâ€™s basically the opposite of JavaScript and itâ€™s running in the browser.

â€” [Tomas Sedovic in a #Rust2018 post](https://aimlesslygoingforward.com/blog/2018/01/10/rust-2018/).
