# Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [cargo-bloat](https://github.com/RazrFalcon/cargo-bloat), a cargo subcommand to find out how much space crates/functions take up in an executable. Thanks to [Vikrant](https://users.rust-lang.org/u/nasa42) for the suggestion!

[Submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!
