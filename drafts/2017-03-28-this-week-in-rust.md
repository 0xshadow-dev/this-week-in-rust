## Approved RFCs

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments)
process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* [RFC 1860: Include the `ManuallyDrop` wrapper in `core::mem`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1860).
* [RFC 1884: Add unstable sort to libcore](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1884).
* [RFC 1869: Write to standard error with `eprint!` and `eprintln!`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1869).

## Final Comment Period

Every week [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the
'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs which are reaching a
decision. Express your opinions now. [This week's FCPs][fcp] are:

[fcp]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/labels/final-comment-period

* [disposition: postpone] [Revisiting specialization: Complementary traits](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1658).
* [disposition: close] [Extend the `Hasher` trait with `fn delimit` to support one-shot hashing](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1666).
* [disposition: postpone] [Disjointness based on associated types](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1672).
* [disposition: merge] [Deprecate anonymous parameters](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1685).
* [disposition: merge] [Add a `compile_error!` macro to libstd](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1695). `compile_error!` will unconditionally cause compilation to fail with the given error message when encountered.
* [disposition: merge] [Extend entry API to work on borrowed keys](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1769).
* [disposition: merge] [extend `?` to operate over other types](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1859).
* [disposition: postpone] [Add a `#[safe("Reason")]` to annotate why unsafe blocks are actually safe](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1910).
* [disposition: postpone] [Polymorphic Numeric Constants](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1945).

## New RFCs

* [Provide a more explicit way to "clone" a standard reference counted pointer](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1954).
* [Introduce Cargo schema versioning](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1953).
* [Expand and stabilize `impl Trait`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1951).

## Style RFCs

[Style RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs) are part of the process for deciding on style guidelines for the Rust community and defaults for [Rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt). The process is similar to the RFC process, but we try to reach rough consensus on issues (including a final comment period) before progressing to PRs. Just like the RFC process, all users are welcome to comment and submit RFCs. If you want to help decide what Rust code should look like, come get involved!

Issues in final comment period:

* [Ordering of types of groups within a module](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/71).
* [where clauses](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/38)
* [Ranges](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/60)
* [Conventions for blank lines](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/57)

Other significant issues:

* [expressions (tracking issue)](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/16)

Good first issues:

We're happy to mentor these, please reach out to us in #rust-style if you'd like to get invovled

* [simple expressions](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/68)
* [assignment and assignment operators](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/67)
