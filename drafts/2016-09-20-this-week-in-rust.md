# Updates from Rust Community

## News & Blog Posts

* [GFX Programming Model](http://gfx-rs.github.io/2016/09/14/programming-model.html). A deep dive into what makes gfx-rs complex and awesome.

## New Crates & Project Updates

* [releasetag](https://crates.io/crates/releasetag) release-tags to be extracted from core-files postmortem (upgrade 0.6.0 for rust 1.12/1.13)

# Crate of the Week

This week's crate of the week is (the in best TWiR-tradition shamelessly self-promoted) [mysql-proxy](https://crates.io/crates/mysql-proxy), a flexible, lightweight and scalable proxy for MySQL databases. Thanks to [andygrove](https://users.rust-lang.org/users/andygrove) for the suggestion!

[Submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

# Call for Participation

Always wanted to contribute to open-source projects but didn't know where to start?
Every week we highlight some tasks from the Rust community for you to pick and get started!

Some of these tasks may also have mentors available, visit the task page for more information.

* [hard] [rust: Support Apple app store bitcode](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/35968).
* [hard] [rust: Missed opportunities to eliminate bounds checks](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/35981).
* [easy] [tempdir: make directory removal robust on windows](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/tempdir/issues/15). This bug lets you publish a replacement for the unreliable `std::fs::remove_dir_all` fn.
* [moderate] [rust: Create official .deb packages](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/28307).
* [easy] [rust-www: Better front-page example](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-www/issues/180).
  The front page example on the website isn't so special. Make it shine.

If you are a Rust project owner and are looking for contributors, please submit tasks [here][guidelines].

## Approved RFCs

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments)
process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* [RFC 1620: regex 1.0](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1620).

## Final Comment Period

Every week [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the
'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs which are reaching a
decision. Express your opinions now. [This week's FCPs][fcp] are:

[fcp]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/labels/final-comment-period

* [`mem::discriminant()`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1696). Add a function that extracts the discriminant from an enum variant as a comparable, hashable, printable, but (for now) opaque and unorderable type.
* [Add a compiler flag that emits crate dependencies on a best-effort basis](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1622).

## New RFCs

* [Check future-proofing of `macro_rules!` using FIRST sets](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1746).
