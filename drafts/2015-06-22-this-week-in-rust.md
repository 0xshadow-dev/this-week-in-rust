* A summary of the major changes to [Rust by example](http://rustbyexample.com/)
in the past few months include:
 - February 15, 2015: The [flow control section](http://rustbyexample.com/flow_control.html)

all flow control operations together.
 - March 21, 2015: The [formatting section](http://rustbyexample.com/hello/print.html)
was [revised](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-by-example/pull/496) so new
users are immediately confronted with the distinction of `Debug` and `Display`
and how to deal with them.
 - May 2, 2015: The table of contents was [reorganized](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-by-example/pull/561)
so examples are sorted consistently by categories.
