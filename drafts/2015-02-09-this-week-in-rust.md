Hello and welcome to another issue of *This Week in Rust*!
[Rust](http://rust-lang.org) is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed. This is a weekly summary of its progress and
community. Want something mentioned? [Send me an

# What's cooking on master?

99 pull requests were [merged in the last week][merged], and 11 [RFCs][rfcs].

Now you can follow breaking changes *[as they happen][BitRust]*!

## Breaking Changes

* `std::path` [has been rewritten][path] to improve ergonomics and
  better support platform-spcific features. The old path module still
  exists as `std::old_path` and remains exported by the prelude (for
  now). [RFC][path-rfc].
* [`std::env`][env] has been added to the standard library as an
  overhaul of the existing `std::os` module, which is now
  deprecated. Part of the almighty [RFC 517][env-rfc].
* And also we've got a [new `std::io` module][io], again part of
  the [mother of RFCs][io-rfc].
* The explicit [closure kind syntax][close] (`|&:|`, `|&mut:|`, `|:|`)
  is obsolete and closure kind is inferred from context.
* In order to make drop semantics optimizable it is no longer possible
  to [move into uninitialized arrays or out of fixed sized
  arrays][array]. [RFC][array-rfc].
* The `#![no_std]` attribute that allows for operation without the
  standard library has [been placed behind the `no_std` feature
  gate][no_std].
* The scope if iterator expressions has been [narrowed][scope] in a
  way that breaks minor corner-cases.
* The deprecated `MaybeOwnedVector` type [has been removed][maybe].

## Other Changes

* The `boxed::into_raw` and `Box::frow_raw` functions [convert between
  `Box<T>` and `*mut T`][boxraw], a common pattern for creating raw
  pointers.
* Initial [support for OpenBSD][openbsd] and [BitRig][bitrig], an OpenBSD fork,
  appeared this week, from SÃ©bastien Marie and Dave Huseby respectively.
