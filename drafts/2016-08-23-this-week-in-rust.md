# Call for Participation

Always wanted to contribute to open-source projects but didn't know where to start?
Every week we highlight some tasks from the Rust community for you to pick and get started!

Some of these tasks may also have mentors available, visit the task page for more information.

* [moderate] [rust-www: Add a section to the front page with 3 rotating 'friends'](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-www/issues/477).
  This is an important change to how we present Rust that everybody will see.
* [easy] [rust: Error code list which need to be updated to new format](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/35233).
* [easy] [servo: Do not define Pipeline::setup_common when on Windows](https://github.com/servo/servo/issues/12856).
* [easy] [rustup: Don't capture backtraces without RUST_BACKTRACE=1](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustup.rs/issues/591#issuecomment-236235677).
  An easy fix, done in two steps, first modifying error-chain, then upgrading it in rustup.
* [easy] [rustup: Add command to install shell
  completions](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustup.rs/issues/387#issuecomment-234675568).
* [moderate] [rust: improve error message when resolution via Deref
  actually required
  DerefMut](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/28419). Good
  first type system bug.
* [hard] [imag: implement bindings to lua/lisp (ketos)/rhai for the filter
  library](https://github.com/matthiasbeyer/imag/issues/245)

If you are a Rust project owner and are looking for contributors, please submit tasks [here][guidelines].
