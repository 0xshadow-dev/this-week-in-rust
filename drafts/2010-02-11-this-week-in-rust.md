# Quote of the Week

This week we have two (related) quotes:

> **Even with just basic optimization, Rust was able to outperform the hyper hand-tuned Go version.** This is a huge testament to how easy it is to write efficient programs with Rust compared to the deep dive we had to do with Go.
>
> [..] After a bit of profiling and performance optimizations, **we were able to beat Go on every single performance metric** . Latency, CPU, and memory were all better in the Rust version.

‚Äì [Jesse Howard on the discord blog](https://blog.discordapp.com/why-discord-is-switching-from-go-to-rust-a190bbca2b1f)

> The consistency angle really shouldn‚Äôt be overlooked. Performance is nice, but slow and consistent can still be planned for much more easily than inconsistent.
>
> That was the big aha moment about Rust for me when I pushed out my first project using the language. Being nervous about it I had added way too much instrumentation so that I could know how every bit of it was responding to real traffic. But as soon as I started seeing the data, I was convinced that my instrumentation code was broken. The graphs I was seeing were just so...boring. Straight lines everywhere, no variation...after 24hrs, the slowest response (not P99...literally P100) was within 75ms of the fastest response.
