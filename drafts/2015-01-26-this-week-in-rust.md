Hello and welcome to another issue of *This Week in Rust*!
[Rust](http://rust-lang.org) is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safe, concurrent, and fast. This is a weekly summary of its progress and
community. Want something mentioned? [Send me an
email!](mailto:corey@octayn.net?subject=This%20Week%20in%20Rust%20Suggestion)
Want to get involved? [We love
contributions](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/wiki/Note-guide-for-new-contributors).

This Week in Rust is openly developed [on Github](https://github.com/cmr/this-week-in-rust).
If you find any errors or omissions in this week's issue, [please submit a PR](https://github.com/cmr/this-week-in-rust/pulls).

Flavio, Steve and Alex all made rollups. Thanks!

Now you can follow breaking changes *[as they happen][BitRust]*!

## Breaking Changes

* The `Show` and `String` formatting traits [have been renamed][fmt]
  to `Debug` and `Display` to more clearly reflect their related
  purposes. Automatically getting a string conversion to use with
  `format!{":?}")` is now written `#[derive(Debug)]`.
* Both the `#[start]` and `#[main]` attributes are [feature
  gated][gatemain] as a precaution. Use `#![feature(start)]` and
  `#![feature(main)]` to get them back.

[gatemain]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/21257

## Other Changes

* Abstract [OS-specific string types][osstr], `std::ff::{OsString,
  OsStr}`, provide strings in platform-specific encodings for easier
  interop with system APIs. [RFC][osstr-rfc].
* `extern crate` and `use` [no longer have to be written only at the
  top of a module][viewitems], but can be intermixed with other item
  definitions.
* Brian Leibig [added his LALR grammar][lalr], which parses almost all
  the Rust files that rustc can.
* The (oft-neglegcted) grammar from the manual was [extracted to its
  own file][grammar].
* The [`unconditional_recursion`][recur] lint detects basic
  infinite recursion scenarios that are probably not intended.
