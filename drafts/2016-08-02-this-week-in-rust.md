# Crate of the Week

In what seems to become a kind of tradition, User [gsingh93](https://users.rust-lang.org/users/gsingh93) suggested his [trace](https://crates.io/crates/trace) crate, a syntax extension to insert `print!` statements to functions to help trace execution. Thanks, gsingh93!

[Submit your suggestions for next week][submit_crate]!

# Call for Participation

Always wanted to contribute to open-source projects but didn't know where to start?
Every week we highlight some tasks from the Rust community for you to pick and get started!

Some of these tasks may also have mentors available, visit the task page for more information.

* [easy] [rust: move coerce_match, coerce_calls and related tests into
  run-pass-valgrind](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/21696). Just
  moving tests around. Easy introduction to the build system.
* [easy] [cargo: Can't specify precise crate version if there are
  multiple versions](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/2773).
* [easy] [error-chain: Display implementation should show the error's
  Display, not just the
  description](https://github.com/brson/error-chain/issues/2). Looks
  like a simple fix.
* [easy] [rust: Parsing inconsistencies (lambda, proc,
  return)](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/28784). This bug
  identifies some bugs where the rustc parser disagrees with the
  reference parser. Good first bug for someone interested in parsers.
* [easy] [rust: rustbuild should warn on quotes in
  PATH](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/34959). Easy fix for
  Rust's new build system.
* [easy] [rust: Make it easier to locate deadlocked
  tests](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/2873).  A simple
  enhancement to the test runner to notify the user about long-running
  tests.
* [easy] [rust: Remove obsolete no_stack_check attribute and
  test](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/34915). Easy
  introduction to the compiler and contribution process.
* [easy] [rustfmt: Wrap overlong function
  signatures](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt/issues/1049).
  There are several rustfmt bugs along these lines so this is a
  fertile entrypoint for contributors.
* [easy] [rustup: Add command to install shell
  completions](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustup.rs/issues/387#issuecomment-234675568).
* [easy] [rustup: Clean up toolchain directories after
  uninstall](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustup.rs/issues/596#issuecomment-233716695).
  A simple bug with a clear fix.
* [moderate] [rust: improve error message when resolution via Deref
  actually required
  DerefMut](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/28419). Good
  first type system bug.
* [easy] [imag: Switch to clap in the `imag` binary](https://github.com/matthiasbeyer/imag/issues/566).

If you are a Rust project owner and are looking for contributors, please submit tasks [here][guidelines].

are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* [RFC 1559: Allow all literals in attributes](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1559).

## Final Comment Period

Every week [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the
'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs which are reaching a
decision. Express your opinions now. [This week's FCPs][fcp] are:
