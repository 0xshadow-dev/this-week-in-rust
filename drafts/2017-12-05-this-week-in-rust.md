# Call for Participation

Always wanted to contribute to open-source projects but didn't know where to start?
Every week we highlight some tasks from the Rust community for you to pick and get started!

Some of these tasks may also have mentors available, visit the task page for more information.

* [Contribute to Rust's 2017 impl period](https://www.rustaceans.org/findwork/impl).
* [tera: Allow other type of quotes for strings in the parser](https://github.com/Keats/tera/issues/236). Tera is a template engine for Rust based on Jinja2/Django.
* [tera: Sort filter (and possibly some others)](https://github.com/Keats/tera/issues/233).
* [smallvec: Dedup functionality](https://github.com/servo/rust-smallvec/issues/2). "Small vector" optimization for Rust: Smallvec let's you store up to a small number of items on the stack.

# Quote of the Week

> Indeed. I notice even when after some Rust I return to the “main day job” C, I start to think differently, and it is excellent. Rust is like a complement to good diet and exercise.
