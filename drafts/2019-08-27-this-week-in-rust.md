# Quote of the Week

> Just as Bruce Lee practiced Jeet Kune Do, the style of all styles, Rust is not bound to any one paradigm. Instead of trying to put it into an existing box, it's best to just feel it out. Rust isn't Haskell and it's not C. It has aspects in common with each and it has traits unique to itself.
