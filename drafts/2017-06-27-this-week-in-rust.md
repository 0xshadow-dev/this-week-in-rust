# Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [include_dir](https://crates.io/crates/include_dir), a crate that lets you include entire directory contents in your binary â€“ like `include_str!`, but on steroids. Thanks to [Michael Bryan](https://users.rust-lang.org/u/Michael-F-Bryan) for the suggestion!

[Submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

## Approved RFCs

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments)
process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

*No RFCs were approved this week.*

## Final Comment Period

Every week [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the
'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs which are reaching a
decision. Express your opinions now. [This week's FCPs][fcp] are:

[fcp]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/labels/final-comment-period

* [disposition: merge] [Experimentally add coroutines to Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2033).
* [disposition: merge] [Tiered browser support policy for Rust's web content](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1985).
* [disposition: merge] [Specify `#[repr(transparent)]`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1758).
* [disposition: merge] [Conversions from `&mut T` to `&Cell<T>`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1789).
* [disposition: merge] [Stabilize drop order](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1857).
* [disposition: postpone] [Allow `extern crate` to take a list of crates](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1875).

## New RFCs

* [Add `is_aligned` intrinsic](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2043).
* [Put the RFCs repo under license terms](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2044).
* [Allow a break not only out of `loop`, but of labelled blocks with no loop](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2046).
* [Extend Rust target specification to follow more closely LLVM triple specification](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2048).
* [Zero-Sized References](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2040).

## Style RFCs

[Style RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs) are part of the process for deciding on style guidelines for the Rust community and defaults for [Rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt). The process is similar to the RFC process, but we try to reach rough consensus on issues (including a final comment period) before progressing to PRs. Just like the RFC process, all users are welcome to comment and submit RFCs. If you want to help decide what Rust code should look like, come get involved!

We're making good progress and the style is coming together. If you want to see the style in practice, check out [our example](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/blob/master/example/lists.rs) or use the [Integer32 Playground](https://play.integer32.com/) and select 'Proposed RFC' from the 'Format' menu. Be aware that implementation is work in progress.

Issues in final comment period:

* [[macro_use] on the same line as crate](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/83)
* [trait bounds](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/80)
* [Specify rules for breaking long `where` conditions](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/75)
* [Single-line `where`](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/74)
* [Combining openings and closings](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/61)

Good first issues:

We're happy to mentor these, please reach out to us in #rust-style if you'd like to get involved

# Quote of the Week

> Regarding the C++ discussion, when I started programming the only viable oss version control system was cvs. It was horrible, but better than nothing. Then subversion was created and it was like a breath of fresh air, because it did the same thing well. Then alternatives exploded and among them git emerged as this amazing, amazing game-changer because it changed the whole approach to version control, enabling amazing things.
>
> To me, Rust is that git-like game-changer of systems programming languages because it changes the whole approach, enabling amazing things.
