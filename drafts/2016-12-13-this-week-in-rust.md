Hello and welcome to another issue of *This Week in Rust*!
[Rust](http://rust-lang.org) is a systems language pursuing the trifecta: safety, concurrency, and speed.
This is a weekly summary of its progress and community.
Want something mentioned? Tweet us at [@ThisWeekInRust](https://twitter.com/ThisWeekInRust) or [send us a pull request](https://github.com/cmr/this-week-in-rust).
Want to get involved? [We love contributions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

*This Week in Rust* is openly developed [on GitHub](https://github.com/cmr/this-week-in-rust).
If you find any errors in this week's issue, [please submit a PR](https://github.com/cmr/this-week-in-rust/pulls).

# Call for Participation

Always wanted to contribute to open-source projects but didn't know where to start?
Every week we highlight some tasks from the Rust community for you to pick and get started!

Some of these tasks may also have mentors available, visit the task page for more information.

* [less easy] [unicode-reverse: Fuzz testing](https://github.com/mbrubeck/unicode-reverse/issues/2). unicode-reverse is a Unicode-aware in-place string reverse function in Rust.
* [easy] [tera: Use 64 bits for int/float](https://github.com/Keats/tera/issues/79). Tera is a template engine for Rust based on Jinja2/Django.
* [easy] [tera: Fix include whitespace](https://github.com/Keats/tera/issues/72).
* [easy] [tera: Adding tests (not unit test, the tester feature)](https://github.com/Keats/tera/issues/62).
* [hard] [tera: Add not to mean `!`](https://github.com/Keats/tera/issues/39).
* [hard] [tera: Add a magical variable that dumps the context](https://github.com/Keats/tera/issues/74).
* [less easy] [rayon: Parity with the `Iterator` trait](https://github.com/nikomatsakis/rayon/milestone/2). Rayon: A data parallelism library for Rust.

If you are a Rust project owner and are looking for contributors, please submit tasks [here][guidelines].

## Approved RFCs

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments)
process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* [RFC 1636: Require documentation for all new features](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1636).

## Final Comment Period

Every week [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the
'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs which are reaching a
decision. Express your opinions now. [This week's FCPs][fcp] are:

[fcp]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/labels/final-comment-period

* [Allow intrinsics to be marked as _safe_, overriding the implicit `unsafe` from being in an extern block](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1248).
* [Procedural macros](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1566).

## New RFCs

* [Default struct field values](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1806).
* [Alloca for Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1808). Add a builtin `fn core::mem::reserve<'a, T>(elements: usize) -> StackSlice<'a, T>` that reserves space for the given number of elements on the stack and returns a `StackSlice<'a, T>` to it which derefs to `&'a [T]`.

## Style RFCs

[Style RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs) are part of the process for deciding on style guidelines for the Rust community and defaults for [Rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt). The process is similar to the RFC process, but we try to reach rough consensus on issues (including a final comment period) before progressing to PRs. Just like the RFC process, all users are welcome to comment and submit RFCs. If you want to help decide what Rust code should look like, come get involved!

PRs:

* [Customising Rustfmt (FCP)](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/pull/33).
* [Conventions for Cargo.toml files](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/pull/41).

Final comment period:

* [boolean and arithmetic expressions](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/18).
* [struct and union declarations](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/30).
* [type aliases](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/32).
* [match](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/34).
* [#[macro_use]](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/36).
* [To indent empty lines or not?](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/37).

Other notable issues:

* [function declarations](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/39).
