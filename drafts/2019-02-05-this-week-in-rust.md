# Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [typetag](https://github.com/dtolnay/typetag), a small crate to allow for serde trait objects. Thanks to [Christopher Durham](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704/481) for the suggestion!

[Submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

# Quote of the Week

> Rust is kind of nice in that it lets you choose between type erasure and monomorphization, or between heap-allocation and stack-allocation, but the downside is that you have to choose.
