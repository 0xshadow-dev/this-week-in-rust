# Call for Participation

Always wanted to contribute to open-source projects but didn't know where to start?
Every week we highlight some tasks from the Rust community for you to pick and get started!

Some of these tasks may also have mentors available, visit the task page for more information.

* [Clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rust-clippy) has a lot of [good first issues](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rust-clippy/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22). If you are looking for something specific to get started with, here is one: [Split up our UI-tests into smaller parts](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rust-clippy/issues/2038).
* [rustc-guide](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustc-guide) is a project to write a short guide about how the rust compiler works, and it needs your help. There are some [easier issues](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustc-guide/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AEasy), [issues which might require a bit of investigation/code reading](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustc-guide/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AMedium), and [issues which probably require some advanced knowledge or a lot of time](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustc-guide/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AHard).
* [Help stabilize a subset of Macros 2.0](https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/help-stabilize-a-subset-of-macros-2-0/7252)!
* [good first issue] [distinst: Optimize Partition Moving Algorithm](https://github.com/pop-os/distinst/issues/51). distinst is a distribution installer backend written in Rust.
* [distinst: Reduce LUKS Device Detection Overhead](https://github.com/pop-os/distinst/issues/80).
* [distinst: Use Entire Disk as LUKS / LVM Partition](https://github.com/pop-os/distinst/issues/64).
* [easy] [tokei: Improve tokei's language test coverage](https://github.com/Aaronepower/tokei/issues/63).
* [Get started with these beginner-friendly issues](https://www.rustaceans.org/findwork/starters).

If you are a Rust project owner and are looking for contributors, please submit tasks [here][guidelines].

are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* [Unapprove placement RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2387): [1228: Place left arrow syntax (`place <- expr`)](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1228-placement-left-arrow.md) and [RFC 809: `box` and placement `in`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0809-box-and-in-for-stdlib.md).

## Final Comment Period

Every week [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the
'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs which are reaching a
decision. Express your opinions now. [This week's FCPs][fcp] are:

# Quote of the Week

> Rust is one of those friends that take some time to get along with, but that you'll finally want to engage with for a long term relationship.
