# Quote of the Week

> Explicitness is the fourth core value of Rust. Ironically, I don’t see that “Explicitness” is ever explicitly stated as a goal of Rust.

— [Ian Whitney in a blog post](http://designisrefactoring.com/2016/04/01/rust-via-its-core-values/).

Thanks to [nayru25](https://users.rust-lang.org/users/nayru25) for the suggestion.
