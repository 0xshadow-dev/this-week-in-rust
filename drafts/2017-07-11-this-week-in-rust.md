# Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [strum](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-make), a crate that helps you automate your build workflow beyond what cargo already offers. Thanks to [Sagie Gur Ari](https://users.rust-lang.org/u/sagiegurari) for the suggestion!

[Submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

## Approved RFCs

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments)
process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* [RFC 1857: Stabilize drop order](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1857).
* [RFC 1985: Tiered browser support policy for Rust's web content](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1985).
* [RFC 1758: Specify `#[repr(transparent)]`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1758).
* [RFC 1789: Conversions from `&mut T` to `&Cell<T>`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1789).

## Final Comment Period

Every week [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the
'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs which are reaching a
decision. Express your opinions now. [This week's FCPs][fcp] are:

[fcp]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/labels/final-comment-period

* [disposition: merge] [Experimentally add coroutines to Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2033).
* [disposition: merge] [Amend #1440: allow `const` items to contain drop types](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1817).
* [disposition: merge] [Prepublication dependencies for Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1969).

## New RFCs

* [Evolving Rust through Epochs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2052).
* [Add alternative to Conservative Impl Trait (RFC 1522)](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2051).

## Style RFCs

[Style RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs) are part of the process for deciding on style guidelines for the Rust community and defaults for [Rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt). The process is similar to the RFC process, but we try to reach rough consensus on issues (including a final comment period) before progressing to PRs. Just like the RFC process, all users are welcome to comment and submit RFCs. If you want to help decide what Rust code should look like, come get involved!

The RFC style is now the default style in Rustfmt - try it out and let us know what you think!

An interesting issue:

* [Define short](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/47)

Good first issues:

We're happy to mentor these, please reach out to us in #rust-style if you'd like to get involved

* [paths](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/69)
* [simple expressions](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/68)
* [assignment and assignment operators](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/67)
* [control flow](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/62)
