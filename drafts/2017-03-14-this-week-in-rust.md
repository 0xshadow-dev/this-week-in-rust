## Approved RFCs

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments)
process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* [RFC 1845: `From<&[T]> for Rc<[T]> + From<&str> for Rc<str>`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1845).

## Final Comment Period

Every week [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the
'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs which are reaching a
decision. Express your opinions now. [This week's FCPs][fcp] are:

[fcp]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/labels/final-comment-period

* [disposition: merge] [Add unstable sort to libcore](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1884).
* [disposition: merge] [Write to standard error with `eprint!` and `eprintln!`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1869).
* [disposition: merge] [Include the `ManuallyDrop` wrapper in `core::mem`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1860).
* [disposition: merge] [extend `?` to operate over other types](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1859).
* [disposition: close] [Add variable-length arrays to the language](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1808).
* [disposition: merge] [Extend entry API to work on borrowed keys](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1769).
* [disposition: merge] [Deprecate anonymous parameters](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1685).

## New RFCs

* [Allow the name (qualifier) of an enum variant to be elided in expressions and patterns whenever it can be inferred](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1949).

## Style RFCs

[Style RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs) are part of the process for deciding on style guidelines for the Rust community and defaults for [Rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt). The process is similar to the RFC process, but we try to reach rough consensus on issues (including a final comment period) before progressing to PRs. Just like the RFC process, all users are welcome to comment and submit RFCs. If you want to help decide what Rust code should look like, come get involved!

PRs in final comment period:

* [structs and unions](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/pull/53)

Issues in final comment period:

* [where clauses](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/38)

Other significant issues:

* [expressions (tracking issue)](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/16)
