# Quote of the Week

> Right.  I've never even used this impl, but my first thought upon seeing the question "I have an `Iterator` of `X` and need a `Y`" was to look at the `FromIterator` impls of `Y`.
>
> If that impl *didn't* exist, I'd then look for the following:
>
> * Other `FromIterator<X>` impls for `String` to see if any of those `X` can easily be produced from `char` (and then I would call `map` before `.collect()`).
> * `impl FromIterator<char> for Vec<u8>`.  If this existed I would use `String::from_utf8(iterator.collect())`.
> * `impl Add<char> for String`.  If this existed, I would use `.fold(String::new(), |s, c| s + c)`
> * methods of [char](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.char.html) to see if there's anything that lets you obtain the UTF8 bytes.  Indeed, there is `encode_utf8`, which even gives a `&mut str`, so one can write
>   ```rust
>   .fold(String::new(), |s, c| {
>       let mut buffer = [u8; 4];
>       s += &*c.encode_utf8(&mut buffer);
>       s
>   })
>   ```
> * idly check the [inherent methods of `String`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/string/struct.String.html) for whatever pops out at me
>
> and if I could still find nothing after all of that I'd slam my head into a wall somewhere.
