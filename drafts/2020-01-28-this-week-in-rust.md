# Quote of the Week

> `Rc<RefCell>` is like duct tape.
>
> It's very versatile, and can fix a multitude of problems in a pinch. For some problems, it's even the best thing to use. But if the thing you're building is more than about 10% wrapped in duct tape, you might want to reconsider your design process!
