Title: This Week in Rust 205
Number: 205

Category: This Week in Rust

Hello and welcome to another issue of *This Week in Rust*!
[Rust](http://rust-lang.org) is a systems language pursuing the trifecta: safety, concurrency, and speed.
This is a weekly summary of its progress and community.
Want something mentioned? Tweet us at [@ThisWeekInRust](https://twitter.com/ThisWeekInRust) or [send us a pull request](https://github.com/cmr/this-week-in-rust).
Want to get involved? [We love contributions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

*This Week in Rust* is openly developed [on GitHub](https://github.com/cmr/this-week-in-rust).
If you find any errors in this week's issue, [please submit a PR](https://github.com/cmr/this-week-in-rust/pulls).

# Updates from Rust Community

## News & Blog Posts

* [How to Deploy a Rocket Application to Heroku](http://www.duelinmarkers.com/2017/10/21/how-to-deploy-a-rocket-application-to-heroku.html)
* [Test driven development with Rust](https://matthewkmayer.github.io/blag/public/post/tdd-with-rust/).

# Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [if_chain](https://crates.io/crates/if_chain) a macro that helps combat rightwards drift where code nests many `if`s and `if let`s. Since the
latter cannot be contracted with `&&`, this can be really helpful to make code more readable. Thanks to [Michael Budde](https://users.rust-lang.org/u/mbudde) for
the suggestion.
