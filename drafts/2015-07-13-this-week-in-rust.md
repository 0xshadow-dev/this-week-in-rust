Hello and welcome to another issue of *This Week in Rust*!
[Rust](http://rust-lang.org) is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed. This is a weekly summary of its progress and
community. Want something mentioned? Tweet us at [@ThisWeekInRust](https://twitter.com/ThisWeekInRust) or [send us an

* [1.2 beta will issue warnings about code that will break](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/26829) when [RFC 1156](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1156-adjust-default-object-bounds.md) is implemented. This approved breaking change will fix a major wart and is thought to break no real code.
* [Linux installation will try harder to set up the dynamic linker](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-installer/pull/41), fixing a bad first-run issue where Fedora systems can't run rustc out of the box.
* The `#[prelude_import]` attribute, which is employed by rustc to perform [dark](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/6a3b385cbd6b9044b4447da96aad066e8b257ddf/src/libsyntax/std_inject.rs#L164) and [mysterious](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/6a3b385cbd6b9044b4447da96aad066e8b257ddf/src/librustc_resolve/build_reduced_graph.rs#L292-L294) acts, but is not supposed to be stable. This is not known to break real code.
* `rustc` on Windows now [looks in the registry](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/26741) to find the location of the MSVC linker.
* Inspired by some [poor I/O performance on the forums](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/reading-from-stdin-performance/2025), bluss dug into the problem [and pulled out some big improvements in zero-filling](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/26849) that greatly improve the performance of `Vec::resize` and `Read::read_to_end`.
* GuillaumeGomez [added a host](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/26742) of [new error explanations](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/26879).
* dotdash got some [huge improvements in the performance of `PartialEq` for slices](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/26884).
* `rustc` now uses [LLVM to write archive files where possible](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/26926). Eventually this will eliminate the compiler's dependency on the `ar` utility.
* [Add `String::into_boxed_slice` and `Box<str>::into_string`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/26931).
* Dave Huseby added [initial support for FreeBSD on i686](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/26959). Rust has long worked on 64-bit FreeBSD.
* Simon [updated the gedit syntax highlighter](https://github.com/rust-lang/gedit-config/pull/8).

* [RFC 1102: Rename `connect` to `join`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1102-rename-connect-to-join.md).
