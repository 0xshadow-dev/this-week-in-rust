# Quote of the Week

> I guess I would say that, itâs not only important that it be possible to do a good design in a given language, but that the language actively encourage it by making the bad design painful. I think rust does a FANTASTIC job of this.

â [/u/kyrenn during an AMA on developing a cross-platform game in Rust](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/78bowa/hey_this_is_kyren_from_chucklefish_we_make_and/dosq5qr/).

Thanks to [Kyle Strand](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/twir-quote-of-the-week/328/460) for the suggestion!
