## Approved RFCs

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments)
process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

*No RFCs were approved this week.*

## Final Comment Period

Every week [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the
'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs which are reaching a
decision. Express your opinions now. [This week's FCPs][fcp] are:

[fcp]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/labels/final-comment-period

* [Require documentation for all new features](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1636).

## New RFCs

*No new RFCs were proposed this week.*

## Style RFCs

[Style RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs) are part of the process for deciding on style guidelines for the Rust community and defaults for [Rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt). The process is similar to the RFC process, but we try to reach rough consensus on issues (including a final comment period) before progressing to PRs. Just like the RFC process, all users are welcome to comment and submit RFCs. If you want to help decide what Rust code should look like, come get involved!

PRs:

* [Customising Rustfmt (FCP)](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/pull/33).
* [Conventions for Cargo.toml files](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/pull/41).

Final comment period:

* [boolean and arithmetic expressions](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/18).
* [struct and union declarations](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/30).
* [type aliases](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/32).
* [match](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/34).
* [#[macro_use]](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/36).
* [To indent empty lines or not?](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/37).

Other notable issues:

* [function declarations](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/39).
