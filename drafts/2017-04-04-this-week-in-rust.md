## Approved RFCs

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments)
process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* [Add a `compile_error!` macro to libstd](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1695). `compile_error!` will unconditionally cause compilation to fail with the given error message when encountered.

## Final Comment Period

Every week [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the
'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs which are reaching a
decision. Express your opinions now. [This week's FCPs][fcp] are:

[fcp]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/labels/final-comment-period

* [disposition: postpone] [Polymorphic Numeric Constants](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1945).
* [disposition: merge] [extend `?` to operate over other types](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1859).
* [disposition: merge] [Remove static bound from type_id](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1849).
* [disposition: merge] [Extend entry API to work on borrowed keys](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1769).
* [disposition: merge] [Deprecate anonymous parameters](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1685).

## New RFCs

* [Add functions to the language which take a value and an inclusive range, and will "clamp" the input to the range](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1961).
* [Support profile-specific overrides for cargo features and dependencies](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1956).

## Style RFCs

[Style RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs) are part of the process for deciding on style guidelines for the Rust community and defaults for [Rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt). The process is similar to the RFC process, but we try to reach rough consensus on issues (including a final comment period) before progressing to PRs. Just like the RFC process, all users are welcome to comment and submit RFCs. If you want to help decide what Rust code should look like, come get involved!

Issues in final comment period:

* [Ordering of types of groups within a module](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/71).
* [where clauses](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/38)
* [Ranges](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/60)
* [Conventions for blank lines](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/57)

Other significant issues:

* [expressions (tracking issue)](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/16)

Good first issues:

We're happy to mentor these, please reach out to us in #rust-style if you'd like to get invovled

* [simple expressions](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/68)
* [assignment and assignment operators](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/67)
