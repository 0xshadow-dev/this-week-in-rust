# Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [noisy_float](https://crates.io/crates/noisy_float), a crate with surprisingly useful floating point types that would rather panic than be Not a Number. Thanks to [Ayose Cazorla](https://users.rust-lang.org/u/ayosec) for the suggestion.

[Submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

# Quote of the Week

> _Captain's log, day 21_
>
> We have sailed on Reddit and Twitter for three weeks now, searching far and wide, yet the only thing we found was a barren landscape, with no end in sight. The supplies are shrinking, the men are growing impatient and hungry, and I fear we will have a mutiny soon. But I am stubborn and optimistic, and urge them to hold on and keep waiting until we find a quote of the week.

Thanks to [u/nasa42 for the suggestion](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/82nzc1/this_week_in_rust_224/dvbhyce/)!
