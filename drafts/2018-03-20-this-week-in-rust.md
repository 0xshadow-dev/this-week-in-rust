# Quote of the Week

> _Captain's log, day 21_
>
> We have sailed on Reddit and Twitter for three weeks now, searching far and wide, yet the only thing we found was a barren landscape, with no end in sight. The supplies are shrinking, the men are growing impatient and hungry, and I fear we will have a mutiny soon. But I am stubborn and optimistic, and urge them to hold on and keep waiting until we find a quote of the week.
