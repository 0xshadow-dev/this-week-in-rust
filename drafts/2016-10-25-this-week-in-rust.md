# Crate of the Week

This week's Create of the Week is [xargo](https://github.com/japaric/xargo) - for effortless cross compilation of Rust programs to custom bare-metal targets like ARM Cortex-M. It recently reached version 0.2.0 and you can [read the announcement here](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/xargo-v0-2-0-effortless-cross-compilation-to-custom-bare-metal-targets/7679).

[Submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

## Approved RFCs

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments)
process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

*No RFCs were approved this week.*

## Final Comment Period

Every week [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the
'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs which are reaching a
decision. Express your opinions now. [This week's FCPs][fcp] are:

[fcp]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/labels/final-comment-period

* [Use `#[link(kind)]` to fix imports from native libs on Windows](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1717).
* [Enable customizing the linkage of a platform's C runtime](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1721).
* [Propose a shorthand syntax for constructing struct-like values with _named_ fields](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1682).
* [Let a `loop { ... }` expression return a value via `break my_value;`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1624).

## New RFCs

* [Extend entry API to work on borrowed keys](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1769).

## Style RFCs

[Style RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs) are part of the process for deciding on style guidelines for the Rust community and defaults for [Rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt). The process is similar to the RFC process, but we try to reach rough consensus on issues (including a final comment period) before progressing to PRs. Just like the RFC process, all users are welcome to comment and submit RFCs. If you want to help decide what Rust code should look like, come get involved!

FCP issues:

* [Guiding principles](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/4).
* [Comments](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/17).

Other issues getting a lot of discussion:

* [Imports (`use`)](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/24).
* [Boolean and arithmetic expressions](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/18).
* [Statements](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/11).

_No PRs this week._

# Friends of the Forest

Our community likes to recognize people who have made outstanding contributions
to the Rust Project, its ecosystem, and its community. These people are
'friends of the forest'.

This week's friends of the forest are:

* From [AtheMathmo]:

> I'd like to nominate [bluss] for his work on scientific programming in Rust.
> [ndarray] is a monumental project but in addition to that he has worked
> (really) hard to share that knowledge among others and provided easy-to-use
> libraries like [matrixmultiply]. Without bluss' assistance rulinalg would be
> in a far worse state.

* From [nasa42]:

> I'd like to nominate [Yehuda Katz], the lord of package managers.

> <dRk\> that gives a new array of errors, guess that's a good thing
> <misdreavus\> you passed one layer of tests, and hit the next layer :P
> <misdreavus\> rustc is like onions
> <dRk\> it makes you cry?
