# Call for Participation

Always wanted to contribute to open-source projects but didn't know where to start?
Every week we highlight some tasks from the Rust community for you to pick and get started!

Some of these tasks may also have mentors available, visit the task page for more information.

* [Help stabilize a subset of Macros 2.0](https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/help-stabilize-a-subset-of-macros-2-0/7252)!
* [rustc-guide](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustc-guide) is a project to write a short guide about how the rust compiler works, and it needs your help. There are some [easier issues](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustc-guide/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AEasy), [issues which might require a bit of investigation/code reading](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustc-guide/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AMedium), and [issues which probably require some advanced knowledge or a lot of time](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustc-guide/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AHard).
* [good first issue] [distinst: Optimize Partition Moving Algorithm](https://github.com/pop-os/distinst/issues/51). distinst is a distribution installer backend written in Rust.
