Hello and welcome to another issue of *This Week in Rust*!
[Rust](http://rust-lang.org) is a systems language pursuing the trifecta: safety, concurrency, and speed.
This is a weekly summary of its progress and community.

Want to get involved? [We love contributions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

*This Week in Rust* is openly developed [on GitHub](https://github.com/cmr/this-week-in-rust).
If you find any errors in this week's issue, [please submit a PR](https://github.com/cmr/this-week-in-rust/pulls).

# Crate of the Week

No crate was suggested for this week. So I unilaterally declare [ring](https://crates.io/crates/ring), Brian Smith's Rust crypto implementation, which is finally on crates.io as this week's crate.

Can we have suggestions and votes next week? Pretty please?

[Submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

# Call for Participation

Always wanted to contribute to open-source projects but didn't know where to start?
Every week we highlight some tasks from the Rust community for you to pick and get started!

Some of these tasks may also have mentors available, visit the task page for more information.

* [easy] [tera: Filters to implement (has examples)](https://github.com/Keats/tera/issues/46).
* [easy] [tokei: Update existing languages with their String litreals](https://github.com/Aaronepower/tokei/issues/52).
* [easy] [rust: Error code list which need to be updated to new format](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/35233).
* [easy] [rustup: Don't capture backtraces without RUST_BACKTRACE=1](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustup.rs/issues/591#issuecomment-236235677).
  An easy fix, done in two steps, first modifying error-chain, then upgrading it in rustup.
* [hard] [imag: implement bindings to lua/lisp (ketos)/rhai for the filter
  library](https://github.com/matthiasbeyer/imag/issues/245)
* [hard] [filters: implement `BitAnd`, `BitOr`, `BitXor` and `Not` for all
  implementations of `Filter<N>`](https://github.com/matthiasbeyer/filters/issues/4)
* [easy] [tempdir: make directory removal robust on windows](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/tempdir/issues/15). This bug lets you
  publish a replacement for the unreliable `std::fs::remove_dir_all` fn.
* [easy] [rust: Add version info to source tarball](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/32444).
  Do you love makefiles?
* [moderate] [rust: Create official .deb packages](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/28307).
* [easy] [rustup: Fix PATH order for proxy binaries](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustup.rs/issues/475#issuecomment-241792606).
  Simple task for an important tool.
* [moderate] [rustup: Check for unexpected cargo/rustc during install](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustup.rs/issues/681).
* [easy] [rust-www: Errors displayed after running front-page code look bad](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-www/issues/490).
  Important bug - first impressions matter.
* [easy] [rust-www: Better front-page example](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-www/issues/180).
  The front page example on the website isn't so special. Make it shine.

## Approved RFCs

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments)
process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

*No RFCs were approved this week.*

## Final Comment Period

Every week [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the
'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs which are reaching a
decision. Express your opinions now. [This week's FCPs][fcp] are:

[fcp]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/labels/final-comment-period

* [`mem::discriminant()`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1696). Add a function that extracts the discriminant from an enum variant as a comparable, hashable, printable, but (for now) opaque and unorderable type.
* [Eager expansion of macros](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1628).
* [Add a compiler flag that emits crate dependencies on a best-effort basis](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1622).
* [regex 1.0](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1620).
* [Allow type aliases in enumeration repr attributes](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1605).
* [Introduce `dyn` keyword](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1603).

* [Saturating and checking integer wrapper types](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1534).
* [`libstd::sys`, the great `libstd` refactor](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1502).

## New RFCs
