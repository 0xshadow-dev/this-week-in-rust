## Approved RFCs

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments)
process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* [Amendment to RFC 1192: Make RangeInclusive just a two-field struct](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1980).

## Final Comment Period

Every week [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the
'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs which are reaching a
decision. Express your opinions now. [This week's FCPs][fcp] are:

[fcp]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/labels/final-comment-period

* [disposition: merge] [Finalize syntax and parameter scoping for `impl Trait`, while expanding it to arguments](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1951).
* [disposition: merge] [extend `?` to operate over other types](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1859).
* [disposition: merge] [Specify `#[repr(transparent)]`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1758).
* [disposition: close] [Add Cargo post-build scripts](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1777).

## New RFCs

* [Support of alternate registries in Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2006).
* [Match ergonomics using default binding modes](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2005).

## Style RFCs

[Style RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs) are part of the process for deciding on style guidelines for the Rust community and defaults for [Rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt). The process is similar to the RFC process, but we try to reach rough consensus on issues (including a final comment period) before progressing to PRs. Just like the RFC process, all users are welcome to comment and submit RFCs. If you want to help decide what Rust code should look like, come get involved!

We're making good progress and the style is coming together. If you want to see the style in practice, check out [our example](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/blob/master/example/lists.rs) or use the [Integer32 Playground](https://play.integer32.com/) and select 'Proposed RFC' from the 'Format' menu. Be aware that implementation is work in progress.

Issues in final comment period:

* [Spaces around `=` in attributes](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/82)
* [Return type on new line](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/77) - proposed to close
* [Attribute/doc comment ordering](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/72)
* [Ordering of types of groups within a module](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/71)
* [Function calls](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/65) and [chains of calls](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/66)
* [Combining opening and closing delims](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/61)
* [Where clauses](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/38)
