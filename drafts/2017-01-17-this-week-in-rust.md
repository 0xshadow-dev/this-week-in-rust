# Crate of the Week

This week's Crate of the Week is [alacritty](https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty), an OpenGL-propelled Terminal application. Really fast, nice looking. Missing scrollback. Thanks to Vikrant for the suggestion!

[Submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

# Answer of the Week

This section highlights an exceptional answer to a question about Rust. This week Francis Gagn√© explains on StackOverflow [how to make something public within a crate, but private outside it](http://stackoverflow.com/a/41667202/265521).

## Approved RFCs

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments)
process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* [RFC 1774: Roadmap for 2017](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1774).
* [RFC 1647: Allow `Self` to appear in the where clause of trait impls](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1647).
* [RFC 1414: Add Rvalue-static-promotion](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1414).

## Final Comment Period

Every week [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the
'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs which are reaching a
decision. Express your opinions now. [This week's FCPs][fcp] are:

[fcp]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/labels/final-comment-period

* [crates.io] [What categories should be available on crates.io](https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/pull/488)?
* [Abort by default v2](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1765). Specify abort-by-default in `Cargo.toml` when the user does `cargo new --bin`, as well as various other refinements to the panick strategy system.
* [Allow uncallable method impls to be omitted](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1699).
* [Macros by example 2.0. A replacement for `macro_rules!`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1584).
* [Add syntax for expressing tuples as a head and tail pair, similar to a Lisp cons cell](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1582).
* [Allow coercing non-capturing closures to function pointers](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1558).

## New RFCs

* [`'fn` lifetime ascription](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1847). Add a `'fn` lifetime that is bound to the scope of the body of the current innermost function or closure.
* [Remove static bound from type_id](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1849).
* [`From<&[T]> for Rc<[T]> + From<&str> for Rc<str>`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1845).

## Style RFCs

[Style RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs) are part of the process for deciding on style guidelines for the Rust community and defaults for [Rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt). The process is similar to the RFC process, but we try to reach rough consensus on issues (including a final comment period) before progressing to PRs. Just like the RFC process, all users are welcome to comment and submit RFCs. If you want to help decide what Rust code should look like, come get involved!

Ready for PR:

There's [a lot of them](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aready-for-PR) right now, contributions here would be very welcome. If you want advice or help getting started, please ping nrc, or any other member of the style team, in #rust-style.

Issues in final comment period:

* [Whitespace in associated type syntax](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/51).
* [Against braces always demanding rightward drift](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/50).
* [Disable trailing comma by default](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/42).
* [Conventions for Cargo.toml files (FCP)](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/pull/41).
* [function declarations](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/39).
* [Customisation of Rustfmt should be allowed](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/pull/33).

# Quote of the Week

> This is the first version to have Rust code in it. The public API
remains unchanged. Apologies in advance to distros who will have to
adjust their build systems for Rust - it's like taking a one-time
vaccine; you'll be better off in the end for it.
