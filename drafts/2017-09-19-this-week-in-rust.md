## Final Comment Period

Every week [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the
'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs which are reaching a
decision. Express your opinions now. [This week's FCPs][fcp] are:

# Quote of the Week

> \<heycam\> one of the best parts about stylo has been how much easier it has been to implement these style system optimizations that we need, because Rust
> \<heycam\> can you imagine if we needed to implement this all in C++ in the timeframe we have
> \<bholley\> heycam: yeah srsly
> \<bholley\> heycam: it's so rare that we get fuzz bugs in rust code
> \<bholley\> heycam: considering all the complex stuff we're doing
> * heycam remembers getting a bunch of fuzzer bugs from all kinds of style system stuff in gecko
> \<bholley\> heycam: think about how much time we could save if each one of those annoying compiler errors today was swapped for a fuzz bug tomorrow :-)
> \<njn\> you guys sound like an ad for Rust
