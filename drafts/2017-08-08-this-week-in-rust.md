## Approved RFCs

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments)
process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* [RFC 2027: Tweak object safety rules to allow static dispatch](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2027).
* [RFC 2057: Add replace and swap functions to RefCell](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2057).
* ["Guide-level" and "Reference-level" explanations to replace how we teach and detailed design sections](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2059).

## Final Comment Period

Every week [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the
'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs which are reaching a
decision. Express your opinions now. [This week's FCPs][fcp] are:

[fcp]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/labels/final-comment-period

* [disposition: merge] [Generic associated types (associated type constructors)](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1598).
* [disposition: merge] [Unsafe pointer methods](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1966).
* [disposition: merge] [Allow an optional vert at the beginning of a match branch](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1925).
* [disposition: postpone] [Eager expansion of macros](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1628).
* [disposition: merge] [Future-proofing enums/structs with `#[non_exhaustive]` attribute](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2008).
* [disposition: merge] [Enable nested method calls](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2025).

## New RFCs

* [Automatically usable external crates](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2088).
* [Implied bounds](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2089).
* [Semantic inlining (another try to the unwrap/expect line info problem)](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2091).
* [Allow Irrefutable Patterns in if-let and while-let statements](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2086).

* [Add `std::net::MacAddr48` to `std::net`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2082).

## Style RFCs

[Style RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs) are part of the process for deciding on style guidelines for the Rust community and defaults for [Rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt). The process is similar to the RFC process, but we try to reach rough consensus on issues (including a final comment period) before progressing to PRs. Just like the RFC process, all users are welcome to comment and submit RFCs. If you want to help decide what Rust code should look like, come get involved!

The RFC style is now the default style in Rustfmt - try it out and let us know what you think!

Currently being discussed:

* [Define short](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/47)
* [Special casing some macros](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/86)
