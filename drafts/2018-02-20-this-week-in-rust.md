## Approved RFCs

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments)
process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* [RFC 2195: Formally define repr(u32, i8, etc...) and repr(C) on enums with payloads](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2195).
* [RFC 2056: Allow trivial constraints to appear in where clauses](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2056).
* [RFC 2175: or-patterns in if / while let expressions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2175).
* [RFC 2166: impl-only-use](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2166). The `use ‚Ä¶::{‚Ä¶ as ‚Ä¶}` syntax can now accept `_` as alias to a trait to only import the implementations of such a trait.
* [Issues are not feature requests](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2299).

## Final Comment Period

Every week [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the
'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs which are reaching a
decision. Express your opinions now. [This week's FCPs][fcp] are:

[fcp]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/labels/final-comment-period

* [disposition: merge] [Rust 2018 roadmap](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2314).
* [disposition: merge] [Stable SIMD in Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2325).
* [disposition: merge] [Cargo profile dependencies](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2282).
* [disposition: merge] [Prior art](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2333). A section to the RFC template where RFC authors may discuss the experience of other programming languages.
* [disposition: merge] [Amend RFC 0141 Lifetime elision: Mention deduplicated lifetimes](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2330).
* [disposition: merge] [Hexadecimal integers with fmt::Debug, including within larger types](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2226).
* [disposition: merge] [Raw identifiers](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2151). Add a raw identifier format `r#ident`, so crates written in future language epochs/versions can still use an older API that overlaps with new keywords.
* [disposition: merge] [label-break-value](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2046). Allow a break not only out of `loop`, but of labelled blocks with no loop
* [disposition: merge] [Finalize syntax of `impl Trait` and `dyn Trait` with multiple bounds](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2250).
* [disposition: merge] [`?` repetition in macro rules](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2298).
* [disposition: postpone] [Immovable types](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1858). Add built-in trait `Move` which all existing types will implement. Types which do not implement it cannot move after they have been borrowed
* [disposition: postpone] [Proper tail calls](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1888). Explicit proper tail calls to Rust via the `become` keyword.
* [disposition: postpone] [Movable array iterators](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2185).
* [disposition: close] [Implement Add for OsString](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2020).

## New RFCs

* [Allow `if` and `match` in constants](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2342).
* [Allow locals and destructuring in const fn](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2341).
* [Type alias enum variants](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2338).
