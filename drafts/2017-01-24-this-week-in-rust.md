# Call for Participation

Always wanted to contribute to open-source projects but didn't know where to start?
Every week we highlight some tasks from the Rust community for you to pick and get started!

Some of these tasks may also have mentors available, visit the task page for more information.

* [Rust::from(lang)](https://github.com/mgattozzi/rust-from-lang) is a project to help people transition from other languages to Rust with articles that show how to do something in one language and then how to do it in Rust and comparing the two. You can help by writing examples or request for articles on problems you need help with.
* [easy] [rust: Removal of the lang feature gate tests whitelist](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/39059).
* [rust: Make Rust on wasm + emscripten a reliable, 1st class Rust target](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/38805).

## Approved RFCs

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments)
process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

*No RFCs were approved this week.*

## Final Comment Period

Every week [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the
'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs which are reaching a
decision. Express your opinions now. [This week's FCPs][fcp] are:

[fcp]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/labels/final-comment-period

* [Allow uncallable method impls to be omitted](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1699).
* [Const-dependent type system (also known as, Î -types and value-types)](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1657).
* [Extend `Cell` to work with non-`Copy` types](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1651).
* [Macros by example 2.0. A replacement for `macro_rules!`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1584).
* [Add syntax for expressing tuples as a head and tail pair, similar to a Lisp cons cell](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1582).
* [Allow coercing non-capturing closures to function pointers](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1558).

## Closed RFCs

Following proposals were rejected by [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) after their 'final comment period' elapsed.

* [Abort by default v2](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1765). Specify abort-by-default in `Cargo.toml` when the user does `cargo new --bin`, as well as various other refinements to the panick strategy system.

## New RFCs

*No new RFCs were proposed this week.*

## Style RFCs

[Style RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs) are part of the process for deciding on style guidelines for the Rust community and defaults for [Rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt). The process is similar to the RFC process, but we try to reach rough consensus on issues (including a final comment period) before progressing to PRs. Just like the RFC process, all users are welcome to comment and submit RFCs. If you want to help decide what Rust code should look like, come get involved!

PRs:

* [match](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/pull/56)
* [type aliases](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/pull/55)
* [structs and unions](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/pull/53)

Ready for PR:

There's [a lot of them](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aready-for-PR) right now, contributions here would be very welcome. If you want advice or help getting started, please ping nrc, or any other member of the style team, in #rust-style.

Issues in final comment period:

* [Whitespace in associated type syntax](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/51).
* [`..` vs `_`](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/49).
* [function declarations](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/39).
* [enum declarations](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/31).
* [generics declarations](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/29).

Other significant issues:

* [types](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/15)
* [closures](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/35)
* [where clauses](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/38)
* [`extern` vs `extern "C"`](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/52)

# Quote of the Week

> I really hate the phrase "fighting". Calling it a fight doesn't do justice to the conversations you have with the borrow checker when you use Rust every day. You don't fight with the borrow checker, because there isn't a fight to win. It's far more elegant, more precise. It's fencing; you fence with the borrow checker, with ripostes and parries and well-aimed thrusts. And sometimes, you get to the end and you realize you lose anyway because the thing you were trying to do was fundamentally wrong. And it's okay, because it's just fencing, and you're a little wiser, a little better-honed, a little more practiced for your next bout.
