# Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [paste](https://github.com/jkcclemens/paste), a self-hosted pastebin made of a lot of Rust and a little Ruby. Thanks to [Kyle Clemens](https://users.rust-lang.org/u/jkcclemens) for both crate and suggestion!

[Submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!
