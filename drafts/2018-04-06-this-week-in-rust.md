# Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [Ditto](https://github.com/alex-shapiro/ditto) - CRDTs for common data structures like maps, vecs, sets, text, and JSON. Thanks to [nasa42](https://users.rust-lang.org/u/nasa42) for the suggestion!

# Call for Participation

Always wanted to contribute to open-source projects but didn't know where to start?
Every week we highlight some tasks from the Rust community for you to pick and get started!

Some of these tasks may also have mentors available, visit the task page for more information.

* If youâ€™re interested in language design, please help polish up [the new Delegation RFC draft](https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/new-rfc-for-delegation-anyone-interested-in-contributing/6644/8).
* [rustc-guide](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustc-guide) is a project to write a short guide about how the rust compiler works, and it needs your help. There are some [easier issues](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustc-guide/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AEasy), [issues which might require a bit of investigation/code reading](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustc-guide/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AMedium), and [issues which probably require some advanced knowledge or a lot of time](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustc-guide/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AHard).
* [Get started with these beginner-friendly issues](https://www.rustaceans.org/findwork/starters).

If you are a Rust project owner and are looking for contributors, please submit tasks [here][guidelines].
