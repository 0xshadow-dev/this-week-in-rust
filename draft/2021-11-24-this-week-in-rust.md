### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

A large amount of noise in the comparisons this week, likely due to new
probabilistic query hash verification increasing likelihood of changes in each
benchmark; solutions are being tracked in [rustc-perf#1105].

Otherwise, though, the week largely amounted to a neutral one for performance.
There were some regressions, particularly in doc builds, as a result of the
addition of portable SIMD. These are relatively speaking minor and primarily
impact small crates.

[rustc-perf#1105]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/issues/1105

Triage done by **@simulacrum**.
Revision range: [eee8b9c7..934624f](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=eee8b9c7bafade55981d155dae71657f1cc55a22&end=934624fe5f66ce3fb8abf0597a6deb079783335f&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

5 Regressions, 2 Improvements, 6 Mixed; 2 of them in rollups

41 comparisons made in total

# Quote of the Week

> On the topic of reframing UB, I was reminded of an article about the [mechanics of oaths and vows in historical cultures](https://acoup.blog/2019/06/28/collections-oaths-how-do-they-work/).
>
> When a programmer writes `get_unchecked` , we can imagine them wanting to promise the compiler that they uphold its preconditions. But since the compiler is normally not so trusting of unproven assertions, the programmer swears an *oath* that their argument is in bounds.
>
> The compiler, seeing such a solemn commitment, treats the programmer's word as true and optimizes accordingly. The compiler is so thoroughly convinced that it never even entertains the possibility of doubting the programmer's oath.
>
> But if the programmer has sworn falsely, then they might well suffer divine retribution in the form of nasal demons â€” or worse, subtly baffling program behaviour.
