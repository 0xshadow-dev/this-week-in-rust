### Call for Testing (*New!*)

An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:

* [RFC: Deduplicate Cargo workspace information](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2906)
    - [Tracking Issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/8415)
    - [Testing steps](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/blob/master/src/doc/src/reference/unstable.md#testing-notes)
* [Tracking Issue for scoped threads](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/93203)
    - [Feature documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/thread/fn.scope.html)
* [RFC: Packages as (optional) namespaces](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3243)

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.

### [Approved RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/commits/master)

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments) process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* [RFC: Add target configuration](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3239)

### Final Comment Period

Every week [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the
'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs which are reaching a
decision. Express your opinions now.

#### [RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/labels/final-comment-period)
