### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

Largely a positive week despite taking a significant performance hit from turning on incremental compilation verification for a subsection of the total queries that the compiler does in order to more quickly catch bugs in incremental compilation. Luckily optimizations in bidi detection brought large performance improvements.

Triage done by **@rylev**.
Revision range: [6384dc..eee8b](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=6384dca100f3cedfa031a9204586f94f8612eae5&end=eee8b9c7bafade55981d155dae71657f1cc55a22&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

2 Regressions, 4 Improvements, 4 Mixed; 1 of them in rollups
45 comparisons made in total
