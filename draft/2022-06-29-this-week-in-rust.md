### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

Overall, a positive week for compiler performance with regressions mainly being relegated to smaller issues. This can be see by the fact that 95 test cases in real world crates were improvements while regressions only happened in 22 test cases. The largest improvement was by @nnethercote where the compilation of `#[derive(Debug)]` was improved. This led to an average of 1% improvement in compile times across 124 real world crate test cases.

Triage done by **@rylev**.
Revision range: [abace0..baf382](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=abace0a1f17986d89aedf610819deab2b4afee56&end=baf382e63c023259fa1f9042f8f479f183ca6ed3&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

**Summary**:

|            | mean | max | count |
|:----------:|:----:|:---:|:-----:|
| Regressions ðŸ˜¿ <br /> (primary) | 0.6% | 2.4% | 22    |
| Regressions ðŸ˜¿ <br /> (secondary) | 0.5% | 1.0% | 35    |
| Improvements ðŸŽ‰ <br /> (primary) | -1.1% | -5.2% | 95    |
| Improvements ðŸŽ‰ <br /> (secondary) | -2.3% | -10.3% | 35    |
| All ðŸ˜¿ðŸŽ‰ (primary) | -0.8% | -5.2% | 117   |

### [Call for Testing](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing)
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:

* [RFC: Serve crates-io registry over HTTP as static files](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2789)
    * [Testing steps](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2789#issuecomment-1166155551)

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.

### [Approved RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/commits/master)

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments) process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* *No RFCs were approved this week.*

### Final Comment Period

Every week [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the 'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs
which are reaching a decision. Express your opinions now.
