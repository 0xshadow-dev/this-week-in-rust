# Quote of the Week

> There actually are NOT very many places where the C code‚Äôs behavior conflicts with Rust‚Äôs borrowing rules. This is both somewhat surprising, because there‚Äôs no way this code was written with Rust‚Äôs borrowing semantics in mind, and also entirely sensible, since Rust‚Äôs borrowing semantics are often quite close to how you actually want your code to behave anyway.

‚Äì SimonHeath [porting C to Rust](https://wiki.alopex.li/PortingCToRust)

Thanks to [Pascal Hertleif](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/twir-quote-of-the-week/328/565) for the suggestion!
