### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

Unfortunately a change introduced in [rust-lang/rust#89836](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/89836) has made performance across different compiler artifacts much more variable by embedding compiler version information (including a git commit hash) in demangled symbol names. This means that even if two compiler artifacts are built from the same exact source code (with only the git commit changed), the compiler will have slightly different performance characteristics. This makes comparisons across pull requests virtually impossible. 

The compiler team is still deciding what to do to handle this, but in the mean time, performance testing is largely broken. This issue is currently being tracked in[rust-lang/rustc-perf#1126](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/issues/1126).

Triage done by **@rylev**.
Revision range: [404c847..3d57c61](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=404c8471aba60c2d837fa728e7c729a0f52d5830&end=3d57c61a9e04dcd3df633f41142009d6dcad4399&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

# Quote of the Week

> One reason we keep certain things as hard errors rather than lints: it establishes a baseline
> that you can safely assume about other people's code, since it can't be turned off. And as a
> result, that baseline can become part of people's mental model of Rust itself, rather than
> something that might or might not be true in any given codebase.
>
> We have to take care to not use that lightly, because that places work on all users of Rust to
> maintain code to that baseline. But there are cases where we do. We don't allow using one integer
> type where another was expected. We don't allow certain operations outside an unsafe block. ...
>
> I think the standard we should apply is asking whether something is part of the baseline that
> people should be able to assume about all Rust code, and if that's worth the tradeoff of requiring
> that baseline of all Rust users.
