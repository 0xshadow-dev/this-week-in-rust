### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

### [Call for Testing](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing)
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:

* *No RFCs issued a call for testing this week.*

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.

### [Approved RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/commits/master)

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments) process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* [Rolling co-lead roles for T-compiler](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/commit/2c687cd9712ed4cfe24ac042c12f55b0c908be72)
* [Mention about removal of crate visibility specifier](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/commit/e56963f86d252989bc8b3b55d3a454b9d93ede46)
* [Fixed the associated syntax error in the associated type Trait Headers](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/commit/45d66ff0c063f14371b49caa6dea5d62aa7c9d7e)

### Final Comment Period

Every week, [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the 'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs
which are reaching a decision. Express your opinions now.

#### [RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/labels/final-comment-period)
