## Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [archspec-rs](https://github.com/prefix-dev/archspec-rs), a library to track system architecture aspects.

Thanks to [Orhun ParmaksÄ±z](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704/1302) for the suggestion!

[Please submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

## Call for Testing
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:

* *No calls for testing were issued this week.*

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.

## Call for Participation; projects and speakers

### CFP - Projects

Always wanted to contribute to open-source projects but did not know where to start?
Every week we highlight some tasks from the Rust community for you to pick and get started!

Some of these tasks may also have mentors available, visit the task page for more information.

<!-- CFPs go here, use this format: * [project name - title of issue](link to issue) -->
<!-- * [ - ]() -->

If you are a Rust project owner and are looking for contributors, please submit tasks [here][guidelines].

### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

A quiet week; all the outright regressions were already triaged (the one biggish one was #122077, which is justified as an important bug fix). There was a very nice set of improvements from PR #122070, which cleverly avoids a lot of unnecessary allocator calls when building an incremental dep graph by reusing the old edges from the previous graph.

Triage done by **@pnkfelix**.
Revision range: [3d5528c2..86b603cd](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=3d5528c287860b918e178a34f04ff903325571b3&end=86b603cd792b3f6172ba4f676d7b586c1af7630a&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

3 Regressions, 3 Improvements, 7 Mixed; 1 of them in rollups
78 artifact comparisons made in total

# Quote of the Week

> As a former JavaScript plebeian who has only been semi-recently illuminated by the suspiciously pastel pink, white and blue radiance of Rust developers, NOT having to sit in my web console debugger for hours pushing some lovingly crafted `[object Object]` or `undefined` is a blessing.
