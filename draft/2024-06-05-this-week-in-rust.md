Category: This Week in Rust

Hello and welcome to another issue of *This Week in Rust*!
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is a programming language empowering everyone to build reliable and efficient software.
This is a weekly summary of its progress and community.
Want something mentioned? Tag us at [@ThisWeekInRust](https://x.com/ThisWeekInRust) on X(formerly Twitter) or [@ThisWeekinRust](https://mastodon.social/@thisweekinrust) on mastodon.social, or [send us a pull request](https://github.com/rust-lang/this-week-in-rust).
Want to get involved? [We love contributions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

*This Week in Rust* is openly developed [on GitHub](https://github.com/rust-lang/this-week-in-rust) and archives can be viewed at [this-week-in-rust.org](https://this-week-in-rust.org/).
If you find any errors in this week's issue, [please submit a PR](https://github.com/rust-lang/this-week-in-rust/pulls).

## Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [layoutparser-ort](https://docs.rs/layoutparser-ort), a simplified port of LayoutParser for ML-based document layout element detection.

Despite there being no suggestions, llogiq is reasonably happy with his choice. Are you?

[No matter what your answer is, please submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

## [Call for Testing](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing)
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:

<!-- Calls for Testing go here, use this format:
    * [<RFC Topic>](<RFC URL>)
        * [Tracking Issue](<Tracking Issue URL>)
        * [Testing steps](<Testing Steps URL>)
-->
<!-- or if there are no new or updated RFCs this week, use: * *No New or Updated RFCs were created this week.* -->
<!-- Remember to remove the `call-for-testing` label from the RFC so that the maintainer can signal for testers again, if desired. -->

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.

## Call for Participation; projects and speakers

### CFP - Projects
