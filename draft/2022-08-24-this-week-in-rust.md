### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

Overall some really impressive wins this week. Note in particular
PR [#100209](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/100209), "Lazily
decode SourceFile from metadata" (which improved 75 primary benchmark
scenarios and 158 secondary scenarios) and
PR [#98655](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/98655) "Don't derive
`PartialEq::ne`", which improved 65 primary scenarios and 27 secondary
scenarios). There were a few cases that pnkfelix explicitly decided not
to mark as triaged; see report for more details there.
Also pnkfelix wonders if there is a recent slight-upward trend on max-rss
for the past week, see the [summary graph](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=&end=&kind=percentfromfirst&stat=max-rss)

Triage done by **@pnkfelix**.
Revision range: [14a459bf..4a24f08b](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=14a459bf37bc19476d43e0045d078121c12d3fef&end=4a24f08ba43166cfee86d868b3fe8612aec6faca&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

**Summary**:

| (instructions:u) | mean | range | count |
|:----------------:|:----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| Regressions ‚ùå <br /> (primary) | 0.6% | [0.4%, 0.8%] | 27    |
| Regressions ‚ùå <br /> (secondary) | 0.4% | [0.2%, 0.6%] | 9     |
| Improvements ‚úÖ <br /> (primary) | -1.7% | [-20.1%, -0.3%] | 91    |
| Improvements ‚úÖ <br /> (secondary) | -3.6% | [-18.7%, -0.3%] | 160   |
| All ‚ùå‚úÖ (primary) | -1.2% | [-20.1%, 0.8%] | 118   |


3 Regressions, 4 Improvements, 4 Mixed; 3 of them in rollups
43 artifact comparisons made in total

### [Call for Testing](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing)
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:

* *No RFCs issued a call for testing this week.*

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.

### [Approved RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/commits/master)

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments) process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* *No RFCs were approved this week.*

### Final Comment Period

Every week, [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the 'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs
which are reaching a decision. Express your opinions now.

#### [RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/labels/final-comment-period)
