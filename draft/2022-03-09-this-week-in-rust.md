### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

A relatively noisy week in performance measurements, particularly on the
`externs` incremental benchmark. Based on the timing of the first noise, this
seems to be due to [#93839], which makes me suspect this is related to PGO or
inlining decisions of some kind. [#94373] might help.

Overall a relatively unchanged to slightly good week, with no outright regressions and most
changes relatively small.

# Quote of the Week

> Because it is designed not to own. If you need an owning pointer, use Box.
>
> This is like asking "why there is no chocolate mousse in this burger?". Chocolate mousse is delicious, but it does not belong in a burger. If you want chocolate mousse, then that's fine and you can choose to eat it instead of a burger. But at other times you may want a burger instead.
