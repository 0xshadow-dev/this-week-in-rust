## Calls for Testing
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:

### [RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing)
* *No calls for testing were issued this week.*

### [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/labels/call-for-testing)
* *No calls for testing were issued this week.*

### [Rustup](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/labels/call-for-testing)
* *No calls for testing were issued this week.*

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.

## Call for Participation; projects and speakers

### CFP - Projects

### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

This week saw more regressions than wins, caused mostly by code being reorganized within the
compiler and a new feature being implemented. There have also been some nice improvements caused
by better optimizing spans.

Triage done by **@kobzol**.
Revision range: [1d52972d..b5b13568](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=1d52972dd8592edf4026aa577c8ce69acc0ac2d1&end=b5b13568fb5da4ac988bde370008d6134d3dfe6c&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

**Summary**:

| (instructions:u)                   | mean  | range          | count |
|:----------------------------------:|:-----:|:--------------:|:-----:|
| Regressions ‚ùå <br /> (primary)    | 0.6%  | [0.2%, 2.7%]   | 105   |
| Regressions ‚ùå <br /> (secondary)  | 1.0%  | [0.1%, 6.9%]   | 74    |
| Improvements ‚úÖ <br /> (primary)   | -0.5% | [-1.0%, -0.2%] | 20    |
| Improvements ‚úÖ <br /> (secondary) | -1.4% | [-8.8%, -0.2%] | 32    |
| All ‚ùå‚úÖ (primary)                 | 0.5%  | [-1.0%, 2.7%]  | 125   |


5 Regressions, 3 Improvements, 4 Mixed; 5 of them in rollups
59 artifact comparisons made in total
