### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

Only one outright regression this week. We had some very cool work from cjgillot
to prevent queries from doing expensive clones, by just forcing them all to be
`Copy`! Also, nnethercote's overhaul of interning yielded massive improvements
across many crates. Also, a slew of benchmarks were unexpectedly improved
[quite a lot][] by some changes to way we invoke the linker when building LLVM itself.

[quite a lot]: https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=8d163e66211c529465868a22686f46c5956342a4&end=6655109f58b7d0f4cae7e04eab476e389c9b9a0f

# Quote of the Week

> Due to recent events I feel the need to once again commend the reviewers and ehuss in particular for their amazing communication skills when reviewing PRs like this. I can only imagine how much work it means and how silly some of the changes proposed here might look to a seasoned cargo developer, yet you maintain a constructive, upbeat, and friendly spirit at all times. It's a style that I am aspiring when reviewing PRs myself, and is a prime example for the accessibility and friendliness of the Rust community as a whole.
>
> Thank you!
