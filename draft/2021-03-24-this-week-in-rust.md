## Rust Compiler Performance Triage

Added two benchmarks over the past week to the perf suite - diesel and stm32f4,
which are intended to add to the level of tracking for rustdoc and, for both, a
focus on compiler trait machinery.

Performance results for this week are mixed, but overall largely positive.

Triage done by **@simulacrum**.
Revision range: [861872b..f24ce9b0](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=861872bc453bde79b83ff99d443d035225f10e87&end=f24ce9b0140d9be5a336954e878d0c1522966bb8&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)
