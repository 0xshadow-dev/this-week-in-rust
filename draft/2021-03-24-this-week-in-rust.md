# Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [egg](https://egraphs-good.github.io), a project using e-graphs to provide a new way to build program optimizers and synthesizers.

Thanks to [Daniel Nugent](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704/891) for the suggestion!

[Submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

## Rust Compiler Performance Triage

Added two benchmarks over the past week to the perf suite - diesel and stm32f4,
which are intended to add to the level of tracking for rustdoc and, for both, a
focus on compiler trait machinery.

Performance results for this week are mixed, but overall largely positive.

Triage done by **@simulacrum**.
Revision range: [861872b..f24ce9b0](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=861872bc453bde79b83ff99d443d035225f10e87&end=f24ce9b0140d9be5a336954e878d0c1522966bb8&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

3 Regressions, 3 Improvements, 4 Mixed
