### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

This week, there were a number of cases where the `incr-unchanged` variants of `inflate` went up or down by 5% to 6%; we believe these are instances of increased noise in benchmarks documented on [rustc-perf#1105](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/issues/1105). I was tempted to remove these from the report, but its non-trivial to re-construct the report "as if" some benchmark were omitted.

Otherwise, there were some nice wins for performance. For example, PR [#90996](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/90996) more than halved the time to document builds of `diesel` by revising how we hash `ObligationCauseData`. If anyone is interested, it might be good to follow-up on the effects of PR [#90352](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/90352), "Simplify `for` loop desugar", where we have hypothesized that the increased compilation time is due to more LLVM optimizations being applied.

Triage done by **@pnkfelix**.
Revision range: [934624fe..22c2d9dd](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=934624fe5f66ce3fb8abf0597a6deb079783335f&end=22c2d9ddbf356bcdb718e88ca6ee3665e1e42690&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

1 Regressions, 3 Improvements, 8 Mixed; 3 of them in rollups
34 comparisons made in total

### Approved RFCs

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments) process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

[Constrained Naked Functions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2972)
[Cargo --crate-type CLI Argument](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3180)

### Final Comment Period

'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs which are reaching a
decision. Express your opinions now.

# Quote of the Week

> The design of the safe/unsafe split means that there is an asymmetric trust relationship between Safe and Unsafe Rust. Safe Rust inherently has to trust that any Unsafe Rust it touches has been written correctly. On the other hand, Unsafe Rust cannot trust Safe Rust without care.
>
> As an example, Rust has the [`PartialOrd`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/cmp/trait.PartialOrd.html) and [`Ord`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/cmp/trait.Ord.html) traits to differentiate between types which can "just" be compared, and those that provide a "total" ordering (which basically means that comparison behaves reasonably).
>
> [`BTreeMap`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/collections/struct.BTreeMap.html) doesn't really make sense for partially-ordered types, and so it requires that its keys implement `Ord` . However, `BTreeMap` has Unsafe Rust code inside of its implementation. Because it would be unacceptable for a sloppy `Ord` implementation (which is Safe to write) to cause Undefined Behavior, the Unsafe code in BTreeMap must be written to be robust against `Ord` implementations which aren't actually total â€” even though that's the whole point of requiring `Ord` .
