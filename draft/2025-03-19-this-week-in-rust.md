## Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [dom\_smoothie](https://github.com/niklak/dom_smoothie), a crate for extracting readable content from web pages.

Despite a lack of suggestions this week, llogiq is pleased with his choice.

[Please submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

## Calls for Testing
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.

If you are a feature implementer
and would like your RFC to appear in this list, add a `call-for-testing` label to your RFC along
with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.

* *No calls for testing were issued this week by [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/labels/call-for-testing),
  [Rust language RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing) or
  [Rustup](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/labels/call-for-testing).*

[Let us know](https://github.com/rust-lang/this-week-in-rust/issues) if you would like your feature to be tracked as a part of this list.

### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

A relatively busy week with a large amount of regressions in rollups which made investigations more tricky. Luckily overall the week was an improvement due to some medium sized improvements through improving target feature computation and a type systems internals fix.

Triage done by **@rylev**.
Revision range: [9fb94b32..493c38ba](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=9fb94b32df38073bf63d009df77ed10cb1c989d0&end=493c38ba371929579fe136df26eccd9516347c7a&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

**Summary**:

| (instructions:u)                   | mean  | range           | count |
|:----------------------------------:|:-----:|:---------------:|:-----:|
| Regressions ❌ <br /> (primary)    | 1.7%  | [0.2%, 3.0%]    | 18    |
| Regressions ❌ <br /> (secondary)  | 0.8%  | [0.2%, 2.7%]    | 37    |
| Improvements ✅ <br /> (primary)   | -1.0% | [-10.3%, -0.2%] | 157   |
| Improvements ✅ <br /> (secondary) | -1.7% | [-8.8%, -0.2%]  | 158   |
| All ❌✅ (primary)                 | -0.8% | [-10.3%, 3.0%]  | 175   |


5 Regressions, 5 Improvements, 3 Mixed; 5 of them in rollups
44 artifact comparisons made in total

[Full report here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/8148c03b441e9a23b93dab2f2c7124eaf9ff925b/triage/2025-03-18.md).

### [Approved RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/commits/master)
