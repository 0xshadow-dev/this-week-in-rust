## Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [duplicate](https://docs.rs/duplicate), a proc macro crate for easy parametric code duplication.

Thanks to [Anton Fetisov](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704/1164) for the suggestion!

[Please submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

A fairly mixed week, with several significant improvements and a few
significant regressions. On average, this week saw a slight increase in compile
times.

Triage done by **@simulacrum**.
Revision range: [8f9e09ac..0058748](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=8f9e09ac3ef3fa85d23ad6a0c920d49987144b13&end=0058748944abb3282aba0e0a74823c6411703565&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

4 Regressions, 6 Improvements, 4 Mixed; 2 of them in rollups
39 artifact comparisons made in total

[Full report here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2023-03-14.md)

### [Approved RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/commits/master)

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments) process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* *No RFCs were approved this week.*

### Final Comment Period

Every week, [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the 'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs
which are reaching a decision. Express your opinions now.

#### [RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/labels/final-comment-period)

* *No RFCs entered Final Comment Period this week.*

#### [Tracking Issues & PRs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Afinal-comment-period+sort%3Aupdated-desc)
* [disposition: merge] [Tracking Issue for `{Arc, Rc}::into_inner`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/106894)
* [disposition: merge] [rustdoc: add support for type filters in arguments and generics](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/108629)
* [disposition: merge] [Lint ambiguous glob re-exports](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/107880)

### [New and Updated RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pulls)
* [new] [Add a count parameter to the expect attribute](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3400)
* [new] [Allow cfg-attributes in where clauses](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3399)

### [Call for Testing](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing)
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:

* *No RFCs issued a call for testing this week.*

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.
