# Quote of the Week

> Rust is a very different beast for me. It is a *much* bigger and *much* more capable language. However, I've found that it is, in many ways, a lot more restrictive in how you can approach problems. I frequently find myself being perplexed at how to eloquently solve a problem. When I discover the idiomatic way of doing it I'm usually both blown away by the brilliance of it and a bit disheartened by how difficult it would be to come up with that solution by myself :-).
