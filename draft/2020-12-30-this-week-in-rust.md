## Rust Compiler Performance Triage

* [2020-12-24](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2020-12-24.md):
3 Regressions, 5 Improvements
Major event this week is landing PGO for rustc (on x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu). We
expect other platforms to follow but further investigation will be needed,
especially for cross-compiled platforms. We expect to add LLVM PGO as well.

Triage done by @simulacrum.

See the [full report](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2020-12-24.md) for more.

## Approved RFCs

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments) process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* [Stabilize Cargo's new feature resolver](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2957)

# Quote of the Week

> It took me sometime to let go and embrace getting things working before optimizing. It was a major breakthrough on that journey when I realized that ALL my python variables are `Rc<RefCell<_>>` , so any chance I had to make a variable that was less complicated than that was already a big optimization. If 1/10 Rust variables had to be that complicated it would not feel good, but it would already be 90% better. So if 1/50 make the code ezere to read and maintain then do it!
