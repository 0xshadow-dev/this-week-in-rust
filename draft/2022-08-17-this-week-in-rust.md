## Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [cargo-pgo](https://github.com/Kobzol/cargo-pgo), a cargo subcommand to compile your code with profile-guided optimization and [BOLT](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/tree/main/bolt#readme) for good measure.

Thanks to [Jakub Ber√°nek](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704/1098) for the self-suggestion!

[Please submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

<!-- Perf results go here -->

### Call for Testing

An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:

# Quote of the Week

> TL;DR: my claim is that Rust is attempting to **raise the abstraction** in the programming language and ultimately to join **computer science** and **software engineering** into one single discipline, an ambition that has been around since these disciplines were created.
