### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

A pretty smooth week. All three regressions were small, and two were isolated to rustdoc alone.

Triage done by **@pnkfelix**.
Revision range: [f0c4da49..10dccdc7](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=f0c4da49983aa699f715caf681e3154b445fb60b&end=10dccdc7fcbdc64ee9efe2c1ed975ab8c1d61287&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

3 Regressions, 3 Improvements, 1 Mixed; 2 of them in rollups
53 comparisons made in total
