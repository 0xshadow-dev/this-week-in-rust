### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

A lot of noise in the results this week; there was an lull in the noise
recently, so our auto-inferred noise threshold went down, and thus five PR's
were artificially flagged this week (and three supposed improvements were just
reverting to the mean). Beyond that, we had three nice improvements: the first
to debug builds in #117962 (by ceasing emission of expensive+unused
`.debug_pubnames` and `.debug_pubtypes`), a second to diesel and serde in
#119048 (by avoiding some unnecessary work), and a third to several benchmarks
in #117749 (by adding some caching of an internal compiler structure).

Triage done by **@pnkfelix**.
Revision range: [57010939..bf9229a2](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=57010939ed1d00076b4af0ed06a81ec69ea5e4a8&end=bf9229a2e366b4c311f059014a4aa08af16de5d8&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

6 Regressions, 9 Improvements, 3 Mixed; 5 of them in rollups
67 artifact comparisons made in total

### [Approved RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/commits/master)

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments) process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* *No RFCs were approved this week.*

### Final Comment Period

Every week, [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the 'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs
which are reaching a decision. Express your opinions now.

#### [RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/labels/final-comment-period)

* [disposition: postpone] [RFC: Precise Pre-release Deps](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3263)

#### [Tracking Issues & PRs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Afinal-comment-period+sort%3Aupdated-desc)
* [disposition: merge] [Support async recursive calls (as long as they have indirection)](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/117703)
* [disposition: merge] [make soft_unstable show up in future breakage reports](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/116274)
* [disposition: merge] [Tracking Issue for ip_in_core](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/108443)

### [Language Reference](https://github.com/rust-lang/reference/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Afinal-comment-period+sort%3Aupdated-desc)
* *No Language Reference RFCs entered Final Comment Period this week.*

### [Unsafe Code Guidelines](https://github.com/rust-lang/unsafe-code-guidelines/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Afinal-comment-period+sort%3Aupdated-desc)
* *No Unsafe Code Guideline RFCs entered Final Comment Period this week.*

### [New and Updated RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pulls)
* [RFC: patchable-function-entry](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3543)

### [Call for Testing](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing)
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:

* *No RFCs issued a call for testing this week.*

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.
