## Updates from the Rust Project

<!-- Rust updates go here -->

### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

<!-- Perf results go here -->

### [Approved RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/commits/master)

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments) process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

<!-- Approved RFCs go here, use this format: * [Topic](URL) -->
<!-- or if none were approved this week, use: * *No RFCs were approved this week.* -->
<!-- * []() -->

<!--
### [Approved Major Change Proposals (MCP)](https://forge.rust-lang.org/compiler/mcp.html)
<!~~ MCPs occur infrequently, so this section is commented out by default. ~~>
<!~~ MCPs which have been approved or rejected this week go here, use this format: * [major change accepted|rejected] [Topic](URL) ~~>
-->

### Final Comment Period

Every week, [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the 'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs
which are reaching a decision. Express your opinions now.

#### [RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/labels/final-comment-period)

<!-- RFCs which have entered FCP go here, use this format: * [disposition: merge|close] [Topic](URL) -->
<!-- or if none entered FCP this week, use: * *No RFCs entered Final Comment Period this week.* -->
<!-- * [disposition: ] []() -->

#### [Tracking Issues & PRs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Afinal-comment-period+sort%3Aupdated-desc)

<!-- Tracking Issues which have entered FCP go here, use this format: * [disposition: merge|close] [Topic](URL) -->
<!-- or if none entered FCP this week, use: * *No Tracking Issues or PRs entered Final Comment Period this week.* -->
<!-- * [disposition: ] []() -->

### [Language Reference](https://github.com/rust-lang/reference/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Afinal-comment-period+sort%3Aupdated-desc)
<!-- Remove this section if empty>

### [Unsafe Code Guidelines](https://github.com/rust-lang/unsafe-code-guidelines/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Afinal-comment-period+sort%3Aupdated-desc)
<!-- Remove this section if empty>

### [New and Updated RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pulls)

<!-- New or updated RFCs go here, use this format: * [new|updated] [Topic](URL) -->
<!-- or if there are no new or updated RFCs this week, use: * *No New or Updated RFCs were created this week.* -->
<!-- * [new|updated] []() -->

### [Call for Testing](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing)
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:

<!-- Calls for Testing go here, use this format:
    * [<RFC Topic>](<RFC URL>)
        * [Tracking Issue](<Tracking Issue URL>)
        * [Testing steps](<Testing Steps URL>)
-->
<!-- or if there are no new or updated RFCs this week, use: * *No New or Updated RFCs were created this week.* -->
<!-- Remember to remove the `call-for-testing` label from the RFC so that the maintainer can signal for testers again, if desired. -->

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.
