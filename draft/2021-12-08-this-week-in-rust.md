### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

Overall, many changes this week, but overall an improvement on multiple benchmarks over
the week from a number of pull requests dedicated to optimizations of certain
patterns. We are still seeing a large number of spurious changes due to
[rustc-perf#1105](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/issues/1105), which
has yet to be addressed.

Triage done by **@simulacrum**.
Revision range: [22c2d9d..1c028783](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=22c2d9ddbf356bcdb718e88ca6ee3665e1e42690&end=1c0287830e0fb3c4007afea2819ba03766da6e9c&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

4 Regressions, 4 Improvements, 9 Mixed; 5 of them in rollups
41 comparisons made in total
