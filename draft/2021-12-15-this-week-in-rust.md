### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

A week of mostly rather small changes with many regressions being hard to diagnose. The largest regression comes from the introduction of a new future (desugaring `.await` into a call to `IntoFuture::into_future`). This was deemed acceptable as it only seems to have a negative impact in stress test situations where async/await is used more than one would normally expect. Unfortunately this does mean regressions beat out improvements this week.

Triage done by **@rylev**.
Revision range: [1c0287..ecb65b](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=1c0287830e0fb3c4007afea2819ba03766da6e9c&end=ecb65b0e170fc5275870c9d0fba7267a57cf35e5&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

3 Regressions, 5 Improvements, 5 Mixed; 3 of them in rollups
31 comparisons made in total
