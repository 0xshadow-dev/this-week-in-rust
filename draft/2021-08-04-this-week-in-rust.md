### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

A very quiet week with only improvements. There was one possible regression, but it was removed from consideration due to only barely impacting a somewhat noisy stress-test benchmark. Untriaged pull requests continue to pile up, but there is still not a good process for dealing with them. 

Triage done by **@rylev**.
Revision range: [5c0ca08..998cfe5](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=5c0ca08c662399c1c864310d1a20867d3ab68027&end=998cfe5aad7c21eb19a4bca50f05a13354706970&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

0 Regressions, 3 Improvements, 0 Mixed; 0 of them in rollups

[Full report here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2021-07-27.md).

### Approved RFCs

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments) process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* [`#[derive(Default)]` on enums with a `#[default]` attribute](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3107)
* [RFC: Introduce concat_bytes!() to join [u8] and byte str analogous to concat! for str](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2509)
