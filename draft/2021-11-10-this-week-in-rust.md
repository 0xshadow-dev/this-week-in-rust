### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

The only significant regressions were 1. two PRs that slowed down doc
generation, and 2. some slowdown from the new lints to flag occurrences of
Unicode bidirectional control characters. The doc generation regression is being
investigated.

Triage done by **@pnkfelix**.
Revision range: [3c8f00..6384dc](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=3c8f001d454b1b495f7472d8430ef8fdf10aac11&end=6384dca100f3cedfa031a9204586f94f8612eae5&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

6 Regressions, 3 Improvements, 1 Mixed; 4 of them in rollups
39 comparisons made in total
