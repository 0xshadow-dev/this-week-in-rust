## Rust Compiler Performance Triage

Another week dominated by rollups, most of which had relatively small changes
with unclear causes embedded. Overall no major changes in performance this week.

Triage done by **@simulacrum**.

# Quote of the Week

> The main theme of Rust *is not* systems programming, speed, or memory safety - it's moving runtime problems to compile time. Everything else is incidental. This is an invaluable quality of any language, and is something Rust greatly excels at.
