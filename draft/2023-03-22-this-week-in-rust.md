### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

A mixed week, with some nice wins, but also at least two PR's that were
subsequently reverted, such as the upgrade to LLVM 16. We do want to
note PR [#108944][], which cut down on crate metadata, binary sizes, and
was an overall win on execution time for many benchmarks.

[#108944]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/108944

Triage done by **@pnkfelix**.
Revision range: [00587489..ef03fda3](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=0058748944abb3282aba0e0a74823c6411703565&end=ef03fda339923e659d3d3ca3321de887316d2807&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

1 Regressions, 4 Improvements, 11 Mixed; 2 of them in rollups
37 artifact comparisons made in total

### [Approved RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/commits/master)

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments) process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* *No RFCs were approved this week.*

### Final Comment Period

Every week, [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the 'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs
which are reaching a decision. Express your opinions now.

#### [RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/labels/final-comment-period)

* [disposition: merge] [RFC: result_ffi_guarantees](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3391)

#### [Tracking Issues & PRs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Afinal-comment-period+sort%3Aupdated-desc)
* [disposition: merge] [Initial support for return type notation (RTN)](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/109010)
* [disposition: merge] [rustdoc: add support for type filters in arguments and generics](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/108629)
* [disposition: merge] [rustdoc: run more HIR validation to mirror rustc](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/108576)
* [disposition: merge] [Add a builtin FnPtr trait that is implemented for all function pointers](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/108080)
* [disposition: merge] [Clarify stability guarantee for lifetimes in enum discriminants](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/104299)

### [New and Updated RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pulls)
* *No New or Updated RFCs were created this week.*

### [Call for Testing](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing)
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:

* *No RFCs issued a call for testing this week.*

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.
