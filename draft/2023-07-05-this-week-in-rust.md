### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

A quiet week, with a mixed set of improvements and regressions. Overall
slightly more improvements than regressions.

Triage done by **@simulacrum**.
Revision range: [b5e51db16..52d8c490](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=b5e51db16dfbf5685e32dfe2d9a835a5c695afe4&end=52d8c490a3aabe65cdd9f2d3aed95034dd5dbad7&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

4 Regressions, 4 Improvements, 2 Mixed; 0 of them in rollups

51 artifact comparisons made in total

### [Approved RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/commits/master)

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments) process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* *No RFCs were approved this week.*

### Final Comment Period

Every week, [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the 'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs
which are reaching a decision. Express your opinions now.

#### [RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/labels/final-comment-period)

* [disposition: merge] [RFC: Start working on a Rust specification](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3355)

#### [Tracking Issues & PRs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Afinal-comment-period+sort%3Aupdated-desc)
* [disposition: merge] [Enable coinduction support for Safe Transmute](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/113175)
* [disposition: close] [feat: split `unsafe_code` lint into lint group](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/108975)
* [disposition: merge] [Correct the Android stat struct definitions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/113130)

### [New and Updated RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pulls)
* [new] [Create a Testing sub-team](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3455)
* [new] [Add `f16` and `f128` float types](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3453)
* [new] [RFC: Nested Cargo packages](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3452)
* [new] [Additional float types](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3451)

### [Call for Testing](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing)
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:

* *No RFCs issued a call for testing this week.*

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.
