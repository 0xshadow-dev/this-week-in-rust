#### [Call for Testing](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing)
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:

* [RFC: Checking conditional compilation at compile time](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3013)
    * [Testing steps](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3013#issuecomment-1936648479)

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.

## Call for Participation; projects and speakers

### CFP - Projects

Some of these tasks may also have mentors available, visit the task page for more information.

<!-- CFPs go here, use this format: * [project name - title of issue](link to issue) -->
<!-- * [ - ]() -->

If you are a Rust project owner and are looking for contributors, please submit tasks [here][guidelines].
