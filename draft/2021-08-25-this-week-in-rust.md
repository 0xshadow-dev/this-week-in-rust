### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

A fairly busy week which was to expected given that we've [adjusted our algorithm](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/956) for whether we label a change as a regression or not. Most regressions were relatively small, and only one has not yet been addressed in some way.

Triage done by **@rylev**.
Revision range: [6b2050..aa8f27](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=6b20506d17f4e5e5bf5bcad7e94add4d754b0ae3&end=aa8f27bf4d980023a8b245ceb25a490a18041eb2&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

59 comparisons made in total
3 Regressions, 2 Improvements, 2 Mixed; 0 of them in rollups

[Full report here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2021-08-17.md).

### Approved RFCs

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments) process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These

# Quote of the Week

> Code doesn't deal with resources until it does. Similarly with everything else that forces you to reason about control flow - you don't care about thread management until you do, you don't care about action logs until you do, you don't care about performance until you do... and from the other side, code doesn't need to be exception-safe until it does. The trouble with this kind of "magic" language feature is that correctness becomes non-compositional: you can take two working pieces of code and put them together and get something that doesn't work.
