# Quote of the Week

> You don't declare lifetimes. Lifetimes come from the shape of your code, so to change what the lifetimes are, you must change the shape of the code.

â€“ [Alice Ryhl on rust-users](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/lifetime-of-a-returned-iterator/43732/2)

Thanks to [RustyYato](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/twir-quote-of-the-week/328/883) for the suggestions!
