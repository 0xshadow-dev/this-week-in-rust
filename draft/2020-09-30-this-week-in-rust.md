## Rust Compiler Performance Triage

* [2020-09-28](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2020-09-28.md):
0 Regressions, 1 Improvements, 3 Mixed


Most significant changes this week came in response to regressions discussed in
last week's triage report. Curious readers may be interested in
[#77058](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/77058), in which the removal
of a single field from a struct caused a 25% decrease in wall-times for one
seemingly unrelated benchmark, or
[#76986](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/76986), an ABI change that
should be a pretty clear win but seems to have mixed results.

See the [full report](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2020-09-28.md) for more.

## Approved RFCs

# Quote of the Week

> Rust has a curse (it has many, but this one is critical): inefficient code is generally visible. Experienced developers hate to notice that their code is inefficient. They will recoil at seeing `Arc<RefCell<T>>` , but won't bat an eye at using Python.
