## Rust Compiler Performance Triage

* [2020-06-23](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2020.md#2020-06-23). Lots of improvements this week, and no regressions, which is good. But we regularly see significant performance effects on rollups, which is a concern.

## Approved RFCs

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments) process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* [RFC: Deduplicate Cargo workspace information](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2906)

Every week [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the
'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs which are reaching a
decision. Express your opinions now.
