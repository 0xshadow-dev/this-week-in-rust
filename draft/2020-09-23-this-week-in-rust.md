## Rust Compiler Performance Triage

* [2020-09-21](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2020-09-21.md):
  2 Regressions, 5 Improvements, 4 Mixed

This was the first week of semi-automated perf triage, and thank goodness:
There was a lot going on. Most regressions are either quite small or already
have a fix published.

[#72412](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/72412) is probably the most
interesting case. It fixes a pathological problem involving nested closures by
adding cycle detection to what seems to be a relatively hot part of the code.
As a result, most users will see a slight [compile-time
regression](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=2c69266c0697b0c0b34abea62cba1a1d3c59c90c&end=fdc3405c20122fd0f077f5a77addabc873f20e4c&stat=task-clock)
for their crates.

See the [full report](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2020-09-21.md) for more.

# Quote of the Week

> Sometimes you don't *want* the code to compile. The compiler's job is often to tell you that your code doesn't compile, rather than trying to find some meaning that allows compiling your code.

- [Josh Triplett on rust-internals](https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-returning-automatically-generating-impl-trait/13090/11)

Thanks to [Jacob Pratt](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/twir-quote-of-the-week/328/943) for the suggestion!
