### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

Overall a positive week for non-incremental performance (roughly 0.5% faster),
however, some >1% regressions on multiple incremental benchmarks, primarily due to
[#95563](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/95563), which will hopefully be
investigated in the coming weeks.

Triage done by **@simulacrum**.
Revision range: [7355d971..43d9f3](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=7355d971a954ed63293e4191f6677f60c1bc07d9&end=43d9f3859e0204e764161ee085a360274b5f3e9a&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

2 Regressions, 5 Improvements, 4 Mixed; 0 of them in rollups
57 artifact comparisons made in total

[Full report here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2022-05-24.md)

### [Call for Testing](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing)
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:

* *No RFCs issued a call for testing this week.*

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.

### [Approved RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/commits/master)

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments) process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* *No RFCs were approved this week.*

### Final Comment Period

Every week [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the
'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs which are reaching a
decision. Express your opinions now.

#### [RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/labels/final-comment-period)
