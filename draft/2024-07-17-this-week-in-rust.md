## Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [cargo-wizard](https://github.com/Kobzol/cargo-wizard), a cargo subcommand that applies profile and config templates to your Cargo project to configure it for maximum performance, fast compile times or minimal binary size.

Thanks to [Jakub Ber√°nek](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704/1322) for the suggestion!

[Please submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

## [Call for Testing](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing)
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:

<!-- Calls for Testing go here, use this format:
    * [<RFC Topic>](<RFC URL>)
        * [Tracking Issue](<Tracking Issue URL>)
        * [Testing steps](<Testing Steps URL>)
-->
<!-- or if there are no new or updated RFCs this week, use: * *No New or Updated RFCs were created this week.* -->
<!-- Remember to remove the `call-for-testing` label from the RFC so that the maintainer can signal for testers again, if desired. -->

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.

## Call for Participation; projects and speakers

### CFP - Projects
