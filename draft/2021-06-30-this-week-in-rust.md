### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

A few small regressions on smaller benchmarks (e.g., helloworld), likely
centered around more IR being generated in a few cases.

Triage done by **@simulacrum**.
Revision range: [d192c80..3912083](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=d192c80d2284ba6b5146bb3da586354c3762c72b&end=3912083821c5072f700a75589c8af6a9d3e20a21&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

2 Regressions, 1 Improvements, 0 Mixed; 1 of them in rollups

[Full report here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2021-06-22.md).

# Quote of the Week

> When a panic has a payload that's an object which needs Drops,  
> And the panic hits a catch_unwind for unexpected stops  
> Before if its Drop panicked we'd just crash to your desktops,  
> Now the payload gets forgotten, and you'd better grab some mops!
