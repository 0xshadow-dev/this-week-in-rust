### Research

### Miscellaneous

## Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [flac-coded](https://crates.io/crates/flac-codec), an implementation of (unsurprisingly) the Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC) file format.

Thanks to [tuffy](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704/1449) for the self-suggestion!

[Please submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

[submit_crate]: https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704

## Calls for Testing
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear in this list, add a
`call-for-testing` label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or
guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature need testing.

* *No calls for testing were issued this week by [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/labels/call-for-testing),
  [Rust language RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing),
  [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/labels/call-for-testing) or
  [Rustup](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/labels/call-for-testing).*

[Let us know](https://github.com/rust-lang/this-week-in-rust/issues) if you would like your feature to be tracked as a part of this list.

# Quote of the Week

> You might be asking: why did you rewrite \[...\] in Rust? And yeah, I donâ€™t really have a good reason. Itâ€™s a hobby project. Like gardening, but with more segfaults.

â€“ [Collin Richards on their blog](https://richardscollin.github.io/tmux-rs/)
