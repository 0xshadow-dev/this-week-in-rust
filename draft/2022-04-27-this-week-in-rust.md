# Quote of the Week

> This is the most fundamental philosophy of both the Rust language and the Rust project: we don't think it's sufficient to build robust systems by only including people who don't make mistakes; we think it's better to provide tooling and process to catch and prevent mistakes.

â€“ [Jane Lusby on the inside Rust blog](https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2022/04/19/imposter-syndrome.html)
