## Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [vimania-uri-rs](https://github.com/sysid/vimania-uri-rs), a VIM plugin for file and URI handling.

Thanks to [sysid](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704/1334) for the self-suggestion!

[Please submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

[submit_crate]: https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704

## Calls for Testing
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:

### [RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing)
* *No calls for testing were issued this week.*

### [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/labels/call-for-testing)
* *No calls for testing were issued this week.*

### [Rustup](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/labels/call-for-testing)
* *No calls for testing were issued this week.*

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.

### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

This week we had some trouble with our performance bot, but luckily the issue has been resolved.
In the end, we saw much more improvements than regressions.

Triage done by **@kobzol**.
Revision range: [acb4e8b6..6199b69c](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=acb4e8b6251f1d8da36f08e7a70fa23fc581839e&end=6199b69c53a8c275ca3cd59647ea0af5ca29aae2&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

# Quote of the Week

> I'm pretty sure I'm the only person ever to single handedly write a complex GPU kernel driver that has never had a memory safety kernel panic bug (itself) in production, running on thousands of users' systems for 1.5 years now.
>
> Because I wrote it in Rust.
