### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

<!-- Perf results go here -->

### Call for Testing

An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:

<!-- Pre-Stabilization RFCs go here -->

<!-- RFC and FCP sections go here -->

# Quote of the Week

> Rust is a perfect language for a dad like me, who every day puts kids to sleep, and tired after long day of work and chores, can sit down and possibly write some code for the hobby open source project, even when he's already just half awake. And it usually just works, tend to be robust and make the day feel extra productive.
