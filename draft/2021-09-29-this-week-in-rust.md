## Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [miette](https://crates.io/crates/miette), a library for error handling that is beautiful both in code and output.

Thanks to [Kat MarchÃ¡n](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704/965) for the self-suggestion!

[Please submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

The largest story for the week are the massive improvements that come from enabling the new pass manager in LLVM which leads to consistent 5% to 30% improvements across almost all test cases. The regressions were mostly minor with clear paths for addressing the ones that were not made with some specific trade off in mind.

Triage done by **@rylev**.
Revision range: [7743c9..83f147](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=7743c9fadd64886d537966ba224b9c20e6014a59&end=83f147b3baf21acfc367a6da1045d212cd3957e4&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

4 Regressions, 4 Improvements, 3 Mixed; 0 of them in rollups

43 comparisons made in total

# Quote of the Week

This week we have two great quotes!

> The signature of your function is your contract with not only the compiler, but also users of your function.

â€“ [Quine Dot on rust-users](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/why-rust-lifetime-elision-cannot-inference-the-proper-lifetime-annotations-on-functions/65106/3)

> Do you want to know what was harder than learning lifetimes? Learning the same lessons through twenty years of making preventable mistakes.

â€“ [Zac Burns in his RustConf talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_Jg-rLDy-Y&t=1658s)

Thanks to [Daniel H-M](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/twir-quote-of-the-week/328/1116) and [Erik Zivkovic](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/twir-quote-of-the-week/328/1117) for the suggestions!
