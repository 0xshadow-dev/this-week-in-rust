### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

A week where improvements outweigh regressions. The highlight of the week is the change to split out LLVM profile guided optimization (PGO) and using clang 13 to compile LLVM which led to improvements in many real world crates (e.g., cargo) in the range of 10%. Most regressions were limited and at most in the less than 1% range. We are seeing more performance changes in rollups which are supposed to be performance neutral. We'll have to decide how to best address this.

Triage done by **@rylev**.
Revision range: [9475e609..d45ed750](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=9475e609b8458fff9e444934a6017d2e590642cf&end=d45ed7502ad225739270a368528725930f54b7b6&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

3 Regressions, 4 Improvements, 2 Mixed; 2 of them in rollups;
34 comparisons made in total

# Quote of the Week

> The biggest failure in Rustâ€˜s communication strategy has been the inability to explain to non-experts that unsafe abstractions are the point, not a sign of failure.
