### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

A pretty quiet week, with relatively few statistically significant changes, though some good improvements to a number of benchmarks, particularly in cycle counts rather than instructions.

Triage done by **@simulacrum**.
Revision range: [7e0261e7ea..af78bae](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=7e0261e7ea2085bdc0bc3d0fd6776bf343473858&end=af78bae565e85b9c5698ee909af0652674eca6d4&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

3 Regressions, 3 Improvements, 2 Mixed; 2 of them in rollups

56 artifact comparisons made in total

[Full report here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2023-09-19.md)

### [Approved RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/commits/master)

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments) process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* *No RFCs were approved this week.*

### Final Comment Period

Every week, [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the 'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs
which are reaching a decision. Express your opinions now.

#### [RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/labels/final-comment-period)

* [disposition: merge] [RFC: Unicode and escape codes in literals](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3349)

#### [Tracking Issues & PRs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Afinal-comment-period+sort%3Aupdated-desc)
* [disposition: merge] [stabilize combining +bundle and +whole-archive link modifiers](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/113301)
* [disposition: merge] [Stabilize `impl_trait_projections`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/115659)
* [disposition: merge] [Tracking Issue for `option_as_slice`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/108545)
* [disposition: merge] [Amend style guide section for formatting where clauses in type aliases](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/114901)
* [disposition: merge] [Add allow-by-default lint for unit bindings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/112380)

### [New and Updated RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pulls)
* [new] [RFC: Remove implicit features in a new edition](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3491)
* [new] [RFC: const functions in traits](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3490)

### [Call for Testing](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing)
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:

* *No RFCs issued a call for testing this week.*

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.
