## Rust Compiler Performance Triage

* [2020-01-12](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2021-01-12.md):
1 Regressions, 2 Improvements, 3 Mixed
Overall, a positive albeit quiet week. The largest change came from the incremental compilation working group which delivered large gains in performance caused by [changes](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/76896) in how inlining is handled in debug mode. Unfortunately, these changes may be reversed due to concerns

Triage done by @rylev.

See the [full report](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2021-01-12.md) for more.

# Quote of the Week

> Describing Rust as a systems programming language in 2021 is like describing Microsoft as Windows or Google as search. Yes, Rust is equipped for systems programming, but its applicability is much wider.
