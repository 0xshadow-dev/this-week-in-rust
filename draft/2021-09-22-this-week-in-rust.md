### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

Fairly busy week, with some large improvements on several benchmarks. Several
larger rollups landed, in part due to recovery from a temporary CI outage,
and continued CI trouble since then. This is likely the cause for the
somewhat unusual presence of rollups in our results.

Triage done by **@simulacrum**.
Revision range: [69c4aa290..9f85cd6](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=69c4aa2901ffadf69deaf91b2f90604bcbc2eb36&end=9f85cd6f2ab2769c16e89dcdddb3e11d9736b351&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

2 Regressions, 2 Improvements, 4 Mixed; 2 of them in rollups

31 comparisons made in total

[Full report here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2021-09-14.md).
