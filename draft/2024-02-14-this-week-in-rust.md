### [Approved RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/commits/master)

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments) process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* [eRFC: Iterate on and stabilize libtest's programmatic output](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3558)

### Final Comment Period

Every week, [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the 'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs
which are reaching a decision. Express your opinions now.

#### [RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/labels/final-comment-period)

* [RFC: Rust Has Provenance](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3559)

#### Tracking Issues & PRs
##### [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Afinal-comment-period+sort%3Aupdated-desc)
* [disposition: close] [Implement `Future` for `Option<F>`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/109691)
* [disposition: merge] [Tracking Issue for min_exhaustive_patterns](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/119612)
* [disposition: merge] [Make unsafe_op_in_unsafe_fn warn-by-default starting in 2024 edition](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/120535)

##### [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Afinal-comment-period+sort%3Aupdated-desc)
* [disposition: merge] [feat: respect rust-version when generating lockfile](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/12861)

#### [New and Updated RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pulls)
* *No New or Updated RFCs were created this week.*

#### [Call for Testing](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing)
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:

* [RFC: Checking conditional compilation at compile time](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3013)
  * [Testing steps](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3013#issuecomment-1936648479)

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.
