# Assembling This Week in Rust

Every week your editors assemble a collection of links, quotes, crates, and more for Rustaceans around the globe.

This documents the general process for assembling each of the sections.

## Updates from the Rust Community

[@nellshamrell](https://github.com/nellshamrell) currently covers this section, but would welcome help from additional editors!

(Thank you to [@cdmistman](https://github.com/cdmistman) for covering this section so long! We look forward to when you can return!)

Many of the links featured in this section come from pull requests to this GitHub repo and tweets to the [@ThisWeekInRust](https://twitter.com/ThisWeekInRust).

Others, however, come from editors scanning various places that people tend to post Rust links. These include:

* [r/rust](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/)
* [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/)
* [dev.to](https://dev.to/)

Any link included in This Week in Rust should follow the guidelines in [What do we look for when considering whether to include something in This Week in Rust?](https://github.com/rust-lang/this-week-in-rust#what-do-we-look-for-when-considering-whether-to-include-something-in-this-week-in-rust).
